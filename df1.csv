The combination of evolution and learning can efficiently evolve programs and the fitness improvement has been confirmed in the simulations of tileworld problems, elevator group supervisory control systems, stock trading models and wall following behavior of Khepera robot. However, its adaptability in testing environments, where the situations dynamically change, has not been analyzed in detail yet. In this paper, the adaptation mechanism in the testing environment is introduced and it is confirmed that GNP-RL can adapt to the environmental changes using a robot simulator WEBOTS, especially when unexperienced sensor troubles suddenly occur. The simulation results show that GNP-RL works well in the testing even if wrong sensor information is given because GNP-RL has a function to automatically change programs using alternative actions. In addition, the analysis on the effects of the parameters of GNP-RL is carried out in both training and testing simulations.

This capability is missing in current robot planning systems, which are therefore hindered in their ability to plan part-specific grasps suitable for the current task. In this paper, a novel approach for part-based grasping is presented that combines 3D shape segmentation, programing by human demonstration and manipulation planning. The central advantage over previous approaches is the use of a topological method for shape segmentation enabling both object categorization and robot grasping according to the affordances of an object. Manipulation tasks are demonstrated in a virtual reality environment using a data glove and a motion tracker, and the specific parts of the objects where grasping occurs are learned and encoded in the task description. Tasks are then planned and executed in a robot environment targeting semantically relevant parts for grasping. Planning in the robot environment can be generalized to objects that are similar to the ones used for task demonstration, i.e. objects that belong to the same category.

In domestic settings for service robots complex tasks have to be accomplished. Those tasks benefit from deliberation, from robust action execution and from flexible methods for humanârobot interaction that account for qualitative notions used in natural language as well as human fallibility. Our robot CAESAR deploys AI techniques on several levels of its system architecture. On the low-level side, system modules for localization or navigation make, for instance, use of path-planning methods, heuristic search, and Bayesian filters. For face recognition and humanâmachine interaction, random trees and well-known methods from natural language processing are deployed. For deliberation, we use the robot programming and plan language READYLOG, which was developed for the high-level control of agents and robots; it allows combining programming the behaviour using planning to find a course of action. READYLOG is a variant of the robot programming language Golog. We extended READYLOG to be able to cope with qualitative notions of space frequently used by humans, such as ânearâ and âfarâ. This facilitates humanârobot interaction by bridging the gap between human natural language and the numerical values needed by the robot.

The proposal implements a component-oriented layer-based control architecture structured in three layers: the reactive layer, the execution layer, and the mission layer. Concerning the reactive layer, to improve the vehicle primitives' adaptability to unknown changing environments, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have been programmed. Starting from a learned-in-simulation policy, the RL-based primitive cableTracking has been trained to follow an underwater cable in a real experiment inside a water tank using the Ictineu AUV. The execution layer implements a discrete event system (DES) based on Petri nets (PNs). PNs have been used to safely model the primitives' execution flow by means of Petri net building block (PNBBs) that have been designed according to some reachability properties showing that it is possible to compose them preserving these qualities. The mission layer describes the mission phases using a high-level mission control language (MCL), which is automatically compiled into a PN. The MCL presents agreeable properties of simplicity and structured programming. MCL can be used to describe offline imperative missions or to describe planning operators, in charge of solving a particular phase of a mission. If planning operators are defined, an onboard planner will be able to sequence them to achieve the proposed goals. The whole architecture has been validated in a cable tracking mission divided in two main phases. First, the cableTracking primitive of the reactive layer has been trained to follow a cable in a water tank with the Ictineu AUV, one of the research platforms available in the Computer Vision and Robotics Group (VICOROB), University of Girona, Girona, Spain. Second, the whole architecture has been proved in a realistic simulation of a whole cable tracking mission.

The object placements should not only be stable but also be in their semantically preferred placing areas and orientations. This is challenging because an environment can have a large variety of objects and placing areas that may not have been seen by the robot before. In this paper, we propose a learning approach for placing multiple objects in different placing areas in a scene. Given point-clouds of the objects and the scene, we design appropriate features and use a graphical model to encode various properties, such as the stacking of objects, stability, objectâarea relationship and common placing constraints.

We are interested in a learning approach that can adapt to such changesâbe they due to motor or sensory failures, or also due to the flexible extension of the robot body by, for example, the usage of tools. We focus on learning locally linear forward velocity kinematics models by means of the neuro-evolution approach XCSF.

Most objects are made of multiple parts which are likely to be the entities actually involved in grasp affordances. Therefore, automatic object recognition and robot grasping should take advantage from 3D shape segmentation. This paper presents an approach toward planning robot grasps across similar objects by part correspondence. The novelty of the method lies in the topological decomposition of objects that enables high-level semantic grasp planning.

In particular, given a 3D model of an object, the representation is initially segmented by computing its Reeb graph. Then, automatic object recognition and part annotation are performed by applying a shape retrieval algorithm. After the recognition phase, queries are accepted for planning grasps on individual parts of the object. Finally, a robot grasp planner is invoked for finding stable grasps on the selected part of the object. Grasps are evaluated according to a widely used quality measure. Experiments performed in a simulated environment on a reasonably large dataset show the potential of topological segmentation to highlight candidate parts suitable for grasping.

15,10.1016/j.robot.2011.07.023,,Coupled dynamical system based arm-hand grasping model for learning fast adaptation strategies,ar,Shukla A.,Ecole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,Journal,"Performing manipulation tasks interactively in real environments requires a high degree of accuracy and stability. At the same time, when one cannot assume a fully deterministic and static environment, one must endow the robot with the ability to react rapidly to sudden changes in the environment. These considerations make the task of reach and grasp difficult to deal with. We follow a Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach to the problem and take inspiration from the way humans adapt their reach and grasp motions when perturbed. This is in sharp contrast to previous work in PbD that uses unperturbed motions for training the system and then applies perturbation solely during the testing phase. In this work, we record the kinematics of arm and fingers of human subjects during unperturbed and perturbed reach and grasp motions. In the perturbed demonstrations, the targetâs location is changed suddenly after the onset of the motion. Data show a strong coupling between the hand transport and finger motions. We hypothesize that this coupling enables the subject to seamlessly and rapidly adapt the finger motion in coordination with the hand posture. To endow our robot with this competence, we develop a coupled dynamical system based controller, whereby two dynamical systems driving the hand and finger motions are coupled. This offers a compact encoding for reach-to-grasp motions that ensures fast adaptation with zero latency for re-planning. We show in simulation and on the real iCub robot that this coupling ensures smooth and âhuman-likeâ motions. We demonstrate the performance of our model under spatial, temporal and grasp type perturbations which show that reaching the target with coordinated handâarm motion is necessary for the success of the task.

For multi-robot tasks such as exploration of large environments, some of the available robots may only possess simple embedded controllers with limited memory capacity.

Global path planning can be problematic for the limited memory robots if they are unable to store the entire map in their local memory. Hence, this paper presents and evaluates a two-tiered path planning technique to permit global path planning.

Embedded software systems, such as those that control cell phones, aircraft, and medical equipment, are subject to requirements and constraints that are significantly different from those encountered in the standard desktop computing environment. For example, embedded systems must frequently address challenges that arise from severe resource restrictions (e.g., low memory and network bandwidth), heterogeneous hardware platforms, and safety-critical operations. Software architecture has been shown to be an effective means for coping with such issues, yet traditional courses on embedded software development rarely focus on software architectural abstractions. Instead, they have concentrated on lower-level issues such as programming languages and hardware interfaces. Since 2005 at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, a unique course has been developed that affords students the opportunity to gain experience and insights on developing software architectures for embedded systems.

The NN is trained using evolutionary optimization to learn the residual error of the motion model, which is then added to the odometry data to obtain the full motion model estimate. Stochastic optimization is used, to accommodate any kind of cost function. Prediction and correction are performed simultaneously within our neural framework, which implicitly integrates the motion and sensor models. An evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm is used to progressively refine the neural model until it generates a trajectory that is most consistent with the actual sensor measurements. During this learning process, NeoSLAM does not require any prior knowledge of motion or sensor models and shows consistently good performance regardless of the robot and the sensor noise type. Furthermore, NeoSLAM does not require the data association step at loop closing which is crucial in most other SLAM algorithms, but can still generate an accurate map.

Nevertheless, one of the most important drawbacks of the A* algorithm resides in the heading constraints connected with the grid characteristics. Different solutions were developed in the last years to cope with this problem, based on post-processing algorithms or on improvements of the graph-search algorithm itself.

The CA course considered in this paper has already applied a practical approach for some time. For the I/O subsystem, students must be able to describe what polling and interrupts are and handle them through low-level programming. However, programming at this level in operating system (OS)-driven computers is not possible without being familiar with the kernel and drivers, which is not usually the case for students in an introductory course. Fortunately, there are many bare and specialized embedded systems around that are not OS-driven. In this proposal, the Nintendo DS (NDS) console was used in a classroom setting.

It aims to facilitate the uptake and actual use of robot technologies in therapies for training social skills to autistic children. However, the framework is easy to generalize for an arbitrary humanârobot interaction application, where users with no technical background need to program robots, i.e. in various assistive robotics applications. We identified the main needs of end-user programming of robots as a basic prerequisite for the uptake of robots in assistive applications. These are reusability, modularity, affordances for natural interaction and the ease of use. After reviewing the shortcomings of the existing architectures, we developed an initial architecture according to these principles and embedded it in a robot platform. Further, we used a co-creation process to develop and concretize the architecture to facilitate solutions and create affordances for robot specialists and therapists. Several pilot tests showed that different user groups, including therapists with general computer skills and adolescents with autism could make simple training or general behavioral scenarios within 1 h, by connecting existing behavioral blocks and by typing textual robot commands for fine-tuning the behaviors. In addition, this paper explains the basic concepts behind the TiViPE based robot control platform, and gives guidelines for choosing the robot programming tool and designing end-user platforms for robots.

Most animals have evolved several sophisticated systems of âextrinsic motivationsâ (EMs) that guide them to acquire behaviours allowing them to maintain their bodies, defend against threat, and reproduce. Animals have also evolved various systems of âintrinsic motivationsâ (IMs) that allow them to acquire actions in the absence of extrinsic rewards. These actions are used later to pursue such rewards when they become available. Intrinsic motivations have been studied in Psychology for many decades and their biological substrates are now being elucidated by neuroscientists. In the last two decades, investigators in computational modelling, robotics and machine learning have proposed various mechanisms that capture certain aspects of IMs. However, we still lack models of IMs that attempt to integrate all key aspects of intrinsically motivated learning and behaviour while taking into account the relevant neurobiological constraints. This paper proposes a bio-constrained system-level model that contributes a major step towards this integration. The model focusses on three processes related to IMs and on the neural mechanisms underlying them: (a) the acquisition of actionâoutcome associations (internal models of the agent-environment interaction) driven by phasic dopamine signals caused by sudden, unexpected changes in the environment; (b) the transient focussing of visual gaze and actions on salient portions of the environment; (c) the subsequent recall of actions to pursue extrinsic rewards based on goal-directed reactivation of the representations of their outcomes. The tests of the model, including a series of selective lesions, show how the focussing processes lead to a faster learning of actionâoutcome associations, and how these associations can be recruited for accomplishing goal-directed behaviours. The model, together with the background knowledge reviewed in the paper, represents a framework that can be used to guide the design and interpretation of empirical experiments on IMs, and to computationally validate and further develop theories on them.",NO,1,reinforcement trialanderror learning animals driven multitude processes animals evolved several sophisticated systems extrinsic motivations ems guide acquire behaviours allowing maintain bodies defend threat reproduce animals also evolved various systems intrinsic motivations ims allow acquire actions absence extrinsic rewards actions used later pursue rewards become available intrinsic motivations studied psychology many decades biological substrates elucidated neuroscientists last two decades investigators computational modelling robotics machine learning proposed various mechanisms capture certain aspects ims however still lack models ims attempt integrate key aspects intrinsically motivated learning behaviour taking account relevant neurobiological constraints paper proposes bioconstrained systemlevel model contributes major step towards integration model focuses three processes related ims neural mechanisms underlying acquisition actionoutcome associations internal models agentenvironment interaction driven phasic dopamine signals caused sudden unexpected changes environment b transient focussing visual gaze actions salient portions environment c subsequent recall actions pursue extrinsic rewards based goaldirected reactivation representations outcomes tests model including series selective lesions show focussing processes lead faster learning actionoutcome associations associations recruited accomplishing goaldirected behaviours model together background knowledge reviewed paper represents framework used guide design interpretation empirical experiments ims computationally validate develop theories,intrinsically motivated actionoutcome learning goalbased action recall systemlevel bioconstrained computational model

The purpose of this paper is to present an implementation of a softâcomputing (SC) based navigation approach on a biâsteerable mobile robot, Robucar. This approach must provide Robucar with capability to acquire the obstacle avoidance, target localization, decisionâmaking and action behaviors after learning and adaptation. This approach uses three neural networks (NN) and fuzzy logic (FL) controller to achieve the desired task. The NNs corresponding to the obstacle avoidance and target localization are trained using the backâpropagation algorithm and the last one is based on the reinforcement learning paradigm while the FL controller uses the Mamdani search and match algorithm. Simulation and experimental results are presented, showing the effectiveness of the overall navigation control system.

Design/methodology/approach

In this paper, an interesting navigation approach is applied to a carâlike robot, Robucar, with addition of an action behavior to deal with the generation of smooth motions. Indeed, this approach is based on four basic behaviors; three of them are fused under a neural paradigm using Gradient BackâPropagation (GBP) and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and the last behavior uses a FL controller. It uses a set of suggested rules to describe the control policy to achieve the action behavior.

Findings

In the implemented SCâbased navigation, the intelligent behaviors necessary to the navigation are acquired by learning using GBP algorithm and adaptation using FL. The proposed approach provides Robucar with more autonomy, intelligence and realâtime processing capabilities. Indeed, the proposed NNs and FLC are able to remedy problems of analytical approaches, missing or incorrect environment knowledge and uncertainties which can lead to undesirable effects as the rough velocity changes. The simulation and experimental results display the ability of the proposed SCâbased navigation approach to provide Robucar with capability to intelligently navigate in a priori unknown environment, illustrating the robustness and adaptation capabilities of the approach.

Research limitations/implications

The robots are miniature satellites called SPHERESâan experimental test bed developed by the MIT SSL on the International Space Station (ISS) to test navigation, formation flight and control algorithms in microgravity. The participants compete to win a technically challenging game by programming their strategies into the SPHERES satellites, completely from a web browser. The programs are demonstrated in simulation, on ground hardware and then in a final competition when an astronaut runs the student software aboard the ISS. ZR had a pilot event in 2009 with 10 High School (HS) students, a nationwide pilot tournament in 2010 with over 200 HS students from 19 US states, a summer tournament in 2010 with â¼150 middle school students and an open-registration tournament in 2011 with over 1000 HS students from USA and Europe. The influence of collaboration was investigated by (1) building new web infrastructure and an Integrated Development Environment where intensive inter-participant collaboration is possible, (2) designing and programming a game to solve a relevant formation flight problem, collaborative in natureâand (3) structuring a tournament such that inter-team collaboration is mandated. This paper introduces the ZR web tools, assesses the educational value delivered by the program using space and games and evaluates the utility of collaborative gaming within this framework. There were three types of collaborations as variablesâwithin matches (to achieve game objectives), inter-team alliances and unstructured communication on online forums. Simulation competition scores, website usage statistics and post-competition surveys are used to evaluate educational impact and the effect of collaboration.

Various techniques that address learning from demonstration in robots have been proposed but those do not scale up well. Thus there is a need to discover novel solutions to this problem. Given that the basic idea for such learning comes from nature in the form of imitation in few animals, it makes perfect sense to take advantage of the rigorous study of imitative learning available in relevant natural sciences. In this work a solution for robot learning from a relatively recent theory from natural sciences called the Shared Circuits Model, is sought. Shared Circuits Model theory is a comprehensive, multidiscipline representative theory. It is a modern synthesis that brings together different theories that explain imitation and other related social functions originating from various sciences. This paper attempts to import the shared circuits model to robotics for learning from demonstration. Specifically it: (1) expresses shared circuits model in a software design nomenclature; (2) heuristically extends the basic specification of Shared Circuits Model to implement a working imitative learning system; (3) applies the extended model on mobile robot navigation in a simulated indoor environment; and (4) attempts to validate the shared circuits model theory in the context of imitative learning.

Furthermore, we examine several antecedents of CULA by relying on the second language learning literature. These include computer anxiety, tolerance of ambiguity, and risk taking. Conceptualization of CULA is based on the observation that computer systems use language as communication between the computer and the user, making system usage significantly dependent on the ability of the individual to learn the language.

Our special attention to this extension of finite-state space MC modeling is motivated by numerous opportunities in applying MC models to represent physical variables in automotive and aerospace systems and, subsequently, using these models for fault detection, estimation, prediction, stochastic dynamic programming, and stochastic model predictive control. Our generalized MC modeling framework synergistically combines the notion of transition probabilities with information granulation based on fuzzy partitioning. As compared with the case of more familiar interval partitioning, the transition probabilities in our model are defined for transitions between fuzzy subsets rather than intervals/rectangular cells. Our framework is first introduced for scalar-valued signals and then extended to vector-valued signals. A real-time capable recursive algorithm for learning transition probabilities from measured signal data is derived. Formulas that characterize the possibility distribution of the next signal value and predict the next signal value are given. It is shown that the introduced modeling framework based on MC models defined over fuzzy partitioning inherits all properties and represents a natural extension of MC models defined over interval partitioning, while providing interpolation ability and improved prediction accuracy.

Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a relatively new optimization method inspired by the herd behavior of honey bees, which shows quite intelligence. The purpose of this paper is to propose an improved ABC optimization algorithm based on chaos theory for solving the push recovery problem of a quadruped robot, which can tune the controller parameters based on its search mechanism. ADAMS simulation environment is adopted to implement the proposed scheme for the quadruped robot.

Design/methodology/approach

Maintaining balance is a rather complicated global optimum problem for a quadruped robot which is about seeking a foot contact point prevents itself from falling down. To ensure the stability of the intelligent robot control system, the intelligent optimization method is employed. The proposed chaotic artificial bee colony (CABC) algorithm is based on basic ABC, and a chaotic mechanism is used to help the algorithm to jump out of the local optimum as well as finding the optimal parameters. The implementation procedure of our proposed chaotic ABC approach is described in detail.

Findings

The proposed CABC method is applied to a quadruped robot in ADAMS simulator. Using the CABC to implement, the quadruped robot can work smoothly under the interference. A comparison among the basic ABC and CABC is made. Experimental results verify a better trajectory tracking response can be achieved by the proposed CABC method after control parameters training.

Practical implications

The proposed CABC algorithm can be easily applied to practice and can steer the robot during walking, which will considerably increase the autonomy of the robot.

Originality/value

A parameter training methodology, using the presented intelligent algorithm is proposed to increase the learning capability.

Application to wheeled and manipulation robots operating in real environments.
In this paper, we address the problem of robot navigation in environments with deformable objects. The aim is to include the costs of object deformations when planning the robotâs motions and trade them off against the travel costs. We present our recently developed robotic system that is able to acquire deformation models of real objects. The robot determines the elasticity parameters by physical interaction with the object and by establishing a relation between the applied forces and the resulting surface deformations. The learned deformation models can then be used to perform physically realistic finite element simulations. This allows the planner to evaluate robot trajectories and to predict the costs of object deformations. Since finite element simulations are time-consuming, we furthermore present an approach to approximate object-specific deformation cost functions by means of Gaussian process regression. We present two real-world applications of our motion planner for a wheeled robot and a manipulation robot. As we demonstrate in real-world experiments, our system is able to estimate appropriate deformation parameters of real objects that can be used to predict future deformations. We show that our deformation cost approximation improves the efficiency of the planner by several orders of magnitude.",NO,0,highlights present planning system robots environments deformable objects manipulation robot determines deformation parameters real objects consider costs object deformation finite element simulations deformation costs modeled using gaussian processes efficient planning application wheeled manipulation robots operating real environments paper address problem robot navigation environments deformable objects aim include costs object deformation planning robots motions trade travel costs present recently developed robotic system able acquire deformation models real objects robot determines elasticity parameters physical interaction object establishing relation applied forces resulting surface deformation learned deformation models used perform physically realistic finite element simulations allows planner evaluate robot trajectories predict costs object deformation since finite element simulations timeconsuming furthermore present approach approximate objectspecific deformation cost functions means gaussian process regression present two realworld applications motion planner wheeled robot manipulation robot demonstrate realworld experiments system able estimate appropriate deformation parameters real objects used predict future deformation show deformation cost approximation improves efficiency planner several orders magnitude,learning object deformation models robot motion planning

The proposed approach has a two-level structure. In the first level, the Aâ algorithm based on grids is used to find a geometric path quickly and several path points are selected as subgoals for the next level. In the second level, an approximate policy iteration algorithm called least-squares policy iteration (LSPI) is used to learn a near-optimal local planning policy that can generate smooth trajectories under kinematic constraints of the robot. Using this near-optimal local planning policy, the mobile robot can find an optimized path by sequentially approaching the subgoals obtained in the first level. One advantage of the proposed approach is that the kinematic characteristics of the mobile robot can be incorporated into the LSPI-based path optimization procedure. The second advantage is that the LSPI-based local path optimizer uses an approximate policy iteration algorithm which has been proven to be data-efficient and stable. The training of the local path optimizer can use sample experiences collected randomly from any reasonable sampling distribution. Furthermore, the LSPI-based local path optimizer has the ability of dealing with uncertainties in the environment. For unknown obstacles, it just needs to replan the path in the second level rather than the whole planner.

The method is composed of two parts: teaching phase and playback phase. In the teaching phase, a human operator commands a robot to achieve a manipulation task. All the movements of the robot are recorded. All the images of the teaching scenes are also recorded by a camera. Then, a mapping from the recorded images to the movements is obtained as an artificial neural network. In the playback phase, the motion of the robot is determined by the output of the neural network calculated from scene images.

Tactile sensing and texture recognition is important for controlled manipulation of objects and navigating in one's environment. Yet, providing robotic systems or prosthetic devices with such capability at high density and bandwidth remains challenging. Each sensor node in the presented skin is created by collocating computational elements with individual microphones. These nodes are networked in a lattice and embedded in EcoFlex rubber, forming an amorphous medium. Unlike existing skins consisting of passive sensor arrays that feed into a central computer, our approach allows for detecting, conditioning and processing of tactile signals in-skin, facilitating the use of high-bandwidth signals, such as vibration, and allowing nodes to respond only to signals of interest. Communication between nodes allows the skin to localize the source of a stimulus, such as rubbing or slip, in a decentralized manner. Signal processing by individual nodes allows the skin to estimate the material touched. Combining these two capabilities, the skin is able to convert high-bandwidth, spatiotemporal information into low-bandwidth, event-driven information.

Prior work is mainly about predicting the possibility of a reactive action, and the object's affordance is invariable. However, in the domain of dynamic programming, a robot's task could often be decomposed into several subtasks, and each subtask could limit the search space. As a result, the robot only needs to replan its sub-strategy when an unexpected situation happens, and an object's affordance might change over time depending on the robot's state and current subtask. In this paper, we propose a novel affordance model linking the subtask, object, robot state and optimal action. An affordance represents the first action of the optimal strategy under the current subtask when detecting an object, and its influence is promoted from a primitive action to the subtask strategy. Furthermore, hierarchical reinforcement learning and state abstraction mechanism are introduced to learn the task graph and reduce state space.

Without existing knowledge, learning either needs to be explorative and, thus, slow or-to be more efficient-it needs to rely on supervision, which may not always be available. However, once some knowledge base exists an agent can make use of it to improve learning efficiency and speed. This happens for our children at the age of around three when they very quickly begin to assimilate new information by making guided guesses how this fits to their prior knowledge. This is a very efficient generative learning mechanism in the sense that the existing knowledge is generalized into as-yet unexplored, novel domains. So far generative learning has not been employed for robots and robot learning remains to be a slow and tedious process. The goal of the current study is to devise for the first time a general framework for a generative process that will improve learning and which can be applied at all different levels of the robot's cognitive architecture. To this end, we introduce the concept of structural bootstrapping-borrowed and modified from child language acquisition-to define a probabilistic process that uses existing knowledge together with new observations to supplement our robot's data-base with missing information about planning-, object-, as well as, action-relevant entities.

Because robot pick-and-place tasks are widely used in industrial factories, this paper proposes a framework to learn robot pick-and-place tasks by understanding human hand gestures. The proposed framework is composed of the module of gesture recognition and the module of robot behaviour control. For the module of gesture recognition, transport empty (TE), transport loaded (TL), grasp (G), and release (RL) from Gilbreth's therbligs are the hand gestures to be recognized. A convolution neural network (CNN) is adopted to recognize these gestures from a camera image. To achieve the robust performance, the skin model by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to filter out non-skin colours of an image, and the calibration of position and orientation is applied to obtain the neutral hand pose before the training and testing of the CNN. For the module of robot behaviour control, the corresponding robot motion primitives to TE, TL, G, and RL, respectively, are implemented in the robot. To manage the primitives in the robot system, a behaviour-based programming platform based on the Extensible Agent Behavior Specification Language (XABSL) is adopted. Because the XABSL provides the flexibility and re-usability of the robot primitives, the hand motion sequence from the module of gesture recognition can be easily used in the XABSL programming platform to implement the robot pick-and-place tasks.

With the recent explosion of domain-specific modeling languages, each with its own syntax and semantics, there has been a corresponding explosion in approaches to detecting design patterns that are so much tailored to those many languages that they are difficult to reuse. This makes developing generic analysis tools extremely hard. Such a generic tool is however desirable to reduce the learning curve for pattern designers as they specify patterns for different languages used to model different aspects of a system. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to detecting design patterns of MOF-based modeling languages. MOF is increasingly used to define modeling languages, including UML and BPMN. In our approach, a pattern is modeled with a Visual Pattern Modeling Language and mapped to a corresponding QVT-Relations transformation. Such a transformation runs over an input model where pattern occurrences are to be detected and reports those occurrences in a result model. The approach is prototyped on Eclipse and validated in two large case studies that involve detecting design patternsâspecifically a subset of GoF patterns in a UML model and a subset of Control Flow patterns in a BPMN model.

Various simulations and a real world experiment confirm applicability and usefulness of BILCA.
In this paper, a novel bio-inspired learning control approach (BILCA) for mobile robots based on Learning from Demonstration (LfD), Firefly Algorithm (FA), and homography between current and target camera view is developed. BILCA consists of two steps: (i) first step in which the actuator commands are learned using FA and demonstrations of desired behavior, and (ii) second step in which the obtained wheel commands are evaluated through the real world experiment. Two different problems are considered in this study: trajectory reproduction, and generation of visual control commands for correction of robot orientation. Developed simulations are used to evaluate BILCA in the domain of learning actuator commands for reproduction of different complex trajectories. Results show that the bigger firefly swarms produce better results in terms of accuracy in the final mobile robot pose, and that the desired trajectory is reproduced with minimal error in final control iteration. Likewise, simulations prove that the FA outperforms other metaheuristic techniques. Experiment conducted on a real mobile robot in indoor environment unifies two considered problems within a single transportation task.

Such knowledge is often meticulously hand-coded for a narrow class of tasks, limiting the scope of possible robot competencies. Thus, the primary limiting factor of robot capabilities is often not the physical attributes of the robot, but the limited time and skill of expert programmers. One way to deal with the vast number of situations and environments that robots face outside the laboratory is to provide users with simple methods for programming robots that do not require the skill of an expert. For this reason, learning from demonstration (LfD) has become a popular alternative to traditional robot programming methods, aiming to provide a natural mechanism for quickly teaching robots. By simply showing a robot how to perform a task, users can easily demonstrate new tasks as needed, without any special knowledge about the robot. Unfortunately, LfD often yields little knowledge about the world, and thus lacks robust generalization capabilities, especially for complex, multi-step tasks. We present a series of algorithms that draw from recent advances in Bayesian non-parametric statistics and control theory to automatically detect and leverage repeated structure at multiple levels of abstraction in demonstration data. The discovery of repeated structure provides critical insights into task invariants, features of importance, high-level task structure, and appropriate skills for the task. This culminates in the discovery of a finite-state representation of the task, composed of grounded skills that are flexible and reusable, providing robust generalization and transfer in complex, multi-step robotic tasks.

However, traditional path planning techniques optimize the navigation path solely based on the models of the robot and the environments. Owing to the time-varying environment, the robot is expected to launch the replanning procedure in real-time continuously. It is slow and wastes computing resources for repeated decisions. In this study, a new perspective is adopted which utilizes a knowledge-driven approach for path planning. The concept of relative state tree is proposed to develop an incremental learning method based on a path planning knowledge base. The knowledge library, which stores a collection of the mappings from environmental information to robot decisions, can be established by offline or online learnings.

However, some issues have to be tackled to plan efficiently with stochastic actions.

â¢

A novel multimodal assembly controller (MAC) was designed having minimal assembly information (âZ assembly direction).

â¢

It was demonstrated that knowledge can be refined when other different matting pair are assembled without the need to acquire another primitive knowledge base (PKB).

â¢

The robot learns a new assembly and improves its skills from experience observed by a reduced number of patterns, lower compliant forces and shorter assembly trajectories.

â¢

The MAC demonstrated that can be used in non-structured environments for the kitting process with uncertainties (in position and geometry) for both, the kits and the pegs.
Industrial robots are reliable machines for manufacturing tasks such as welding, panting, assembly, palletizing or kitting operations. They are traditionally programmed by an operator using a teach pendant in a point-to-point scheme with limited sensing capabilities such as industrial vision systems and force/torque sensing. The use of these sensing capabilities is associated to the particular robot controller, operative systems and programming language. Today, robots can react to environment changes specific to their task domain but are still unable to learn skills to effectively use their current knowledge. The need for such a skill in unstructured environments where knowledge can be acquired and enhanced is desirable so that robots can effectively interact in multimodal real-world scenarios.

In this article we present a multimodal assembly controller (MAC) approach to embed and effectively enhance knowledge into industrial robots working in multimodal manufacturing scenarios such as assembly during kitting operations with varying shapes and tolerances. During learning, the robot uses its vision and force capabilities resembling a human operator carrying out the same operation. The approach consists of using a MAC based on the Fuzzy ARTMAP artificial neural network in conjunction with a knowledge base. The robot starts the operation having limited initial knowledge about what task it has to accomplish. During the operation, the robot learns the skill for recognising assembly parts and how to assemble them. The skill acquisition is evaluated by counting the steps to complete the assembly, length of the followed assembly path and compliant behaviour. The performance improves with time so that the robot becomes an expert demonstrated by the assembly of a kit with different part geometries. The kit is unknown by the robot at the beginning of the operation; therefore, the kit type, location and orientation are unknown as well as the parts to be assembled since they are randomly fed by a conveyor belt.",NO,0,highlights novel multimodal assembly controller mac designed minimal assembly information z assembly direction demonstrated knowledge refined different batting pair assembled without need acquire another primitive knowledge base pub robot learns new assembly improves skills experience observed reduced number patterns lower compliant forces shorter assembly trajectories mac demonstrated used nonstructured environments sitting process uncertainties position geometry kits pegs industrial robots reliable machines manufacturing tasks welding painting assembly palletizing sitting operations traditionally programmed operator using teach pendant pointtopoint scheme limited sensing capabilities industrial vision systems forcetorque sensing use sensing capabilities associated particular robot controller operative systems programming language today robots react environment changes specific task domain still unable learn skills effectively use current knowledge need skill unstructured environments knowledge acquired enhanced desirable robots effectively interact multimodal realworld scenarios article present multimodal assembly controller mac approach embed effectively enhance knowledge industrial robots working multimodal manufacturing scenarios assembly sitting operations varying shapes tolerance learning robot uses vision force capabilities resembling human operator carrying operation approach consists using mac based fuzzy artman artificial neural network conjunction knowledge base robot starts operation limited initial knowledge task accomplish operation robot learns skill recognising assembly parts assemble them skill acquisition evaluated counting steps complete assembly length followed assembly path compliant behaviour performance improves time robot becomes expert demonstrated assembly kit different part geometries kit unknown robot beginning operation therefore kit type location orientation unknown well parts assembled since randomly fed conveyor belt,online knowledge acquisition enhancement robotic assembly tasks

The robot control problem becomes finding the control policy which maximizes the probability of satisfying the temporal logic task on the MDP. For a large environment, obtaining transition probabilities for each stateâaction pair, as well as solving the necessary optimization problem for the optimal policy, are computationally intensive. To address these issues, we propose an approximate dynamic programming framework based on a least-squares temporal difference learning method of the actorâcritic type.

It is particularly so for object-oriented methods, defined in the context of the OMG's Model Driven Architecture (MDA), where a key step is to transition from a use case model to an analysis model. However, providing automated support for this transition is challenging, mostly because, in practice, requirements are expressed in natural language and are much less structured than other kinds of development artifacts. Such an automated transformation would enable at least the generation of an initial, likely incomplete, analysis model and enable automated traceability from requirements to code, through various intermediate models. In this article, we propose a method and a tool called aToucan, building on existing work, to automatically generate a UML analysis model comprising class, sequence and activity diagrams from a use case model and to automatically establish traceability links between model elements of the use case model and the generated analysis model. Note that our goal is to save effort through automated support, not to replace human abstraction and decision making.

Seven (six) case studies were performed to compare class (sequence) diagrams generated by aToucan to the ones created by experts, Masters students, and trained, fourth-year undergraduate students. Results show that aToucan performs well regarding consistency (e.g., 88% class diagram consistency) and completeness (e.g., 80% class completeness) when comparing generated class diagrams with reference class diagrams created by experts and Masters students. Similarly, sequence diagrams automatically generated by aToucan are highly consistent with the ones devised by experts and are also rather complete, for instance, 91% and 97% message consistency and completeness, respectively. Further, statistical tests show that aToucan significantly outperforms fourth-year engineering students in this respect, thus demonstrating the value of automation. We also conducted two industrial case studies demonstrating the applicability of aToucan in two different industrial domains. Results showed that the vast majority of model elements generated by aToucan are correct and that therefore, in practice, such models would be good initial models to refine and augment so as to converge towards to correct and complete analysis models. A performance analysis shows that the execution time of aToucan (when generating class and sequence diagrams) is dependent on the number of simple sentences contained in the use case model and remains within a range of a few minutes. Five different software system descriptions (18 use cases altogether) were performed to evaluate the generation of activity diagrams. Results show that aToucan can generate 100% complete and correct control flow information of activity diagrams and on average 85% data flAow information completeness.

We begin by exploring a fundamental impediment to classical motion planning algorithms called the âfreezing robot problemâ: once the environment surpasses a certain level of dynamic complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. We argue that this problem can be avoided if the robot anticipates human cooperation, and accordingly we develop interacting Gaussian processes, a prediction density that captures cooperative collision avoidance, and a âmultiple goalâ extension that models the goal-driven nature of human decision making. We validate this model with an empirical study of robot navigation in dense human crowds (488 runs), specifically testing how cooperation models effect navigation performance. The multiple goal interacting Gaussian processes algorithm performs comparably with human teleoperators in crowd densities nearing 0.8 humans/m2, while a state-of-the-art non-cooperative planner exhibits unsafe behavior more than three times as often as the multiple goal extension, and twice as often as the basic interacting Gaussian process approach. Furthermore, a reactive planner based on the widely used dynamic window approach proves insufficient for crowd densities above 0.55 people/m2.

With the popularity of embedded systems and the consequently rising demand in the job market for professionals well-versed in them, embedded operating systems (EOSs) have become one of the core courses in computer science studies across the world. The objective of EOS courses is to develop students' ability to port, modify, and customize an embedded operating system through a series of laboratory exercises. However, our teaching experience has revealed that beginners require a considerable amount of time to familiarize themselves with the development environment and the relevant processes, such as operating in a command line interface, setting environment variables, and kernel configurations. Furthermore, students need to constantly handle compiler error messages, malfunctions of the target EOS, and incompatibility issues related to development tools. These problems may frustrate and discourage students. A common strategy to address this problem is to dedicate more hours to teaching or to hire more teaching assistants to help students progress. However, none of these methods is suitable for institutions with limited resources. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a computer-assisted learning system called the Computer-assisted Learning Environment (CALEE) to assist students with their assignments and thus motivate them.

In the second stage, a machine learning technique is applied to obtain a controller that maps these high level variables to the control commands that are actually sent to the robot. This paper describes an algorithm that is able to embed the preprocessing stage into the learning stage in order to get controllers directly starting from sensorial raw data with no expert knowledge involved. Due to the high dimensionality of the sensorial data, this approach uses Quantified Fuzzy Rules (QFRs), that are able to transform low-level input variables into high-level input variables, reducing the dimensionality through summarization. The proposed learning algorithm, called Iterative Quantified Fuzzy Rule Learning (IQFRL), is based on genetic programming. IQFRL is able to learn rules with different structures, and can manage linguistic variables with multiple granularities. The algorithm has been tested with the implementation of the wall-following behavior both in several realistic simulated environments with different complexity and on a Pioneer 3-AT robot in two real environments. Results have been compared with several well-known learning algorithms combined with different data preprocessing techniques, showing that IQFRL exhibits a better and statistically significant performance. Moreover, three real world applications for which IQFRL plays a central role are also presented: path and object tracking with static and moving obstacles avoidance.

The transition dynamics of the robots may be unknown or stochastic, making it difficult to select the best action each robot must take at a given time. The observation model, a function of the robots' sensor systems, may be noisy or partial, meaning that deterministic knowledge of the team's state is often impossible to attain. Moreover, the actions each robot can take may have an associated success rate and/or a probabilistic completion time. Robots designed for real-world applications require careful consideration of such sources of uncertainty, regardless of the control scheme or planning or learning algorithms used for a specific problem. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of planning algorithms can be challenging due to the latent variables they often operate on. When performance testing such algorithms on hardware, the simultaneous use of the debugging and visualization tools available on a workstation can be difficult. This transition from experimentation to implementation becomes especially challenging when the experiments need to replicate some feature of the software tool set in hardware, such as simulation of visually complex environments.

Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, does not require previous knowledge, and allows robots to robustly adapt to the environment, but often necessitates an infeasible amount of experience.

Model checking is a formal verification technique that can help ensure the safety of autonomous systems, but in most cases it cannot be applied by novices, or in its straight âoff-the-shelfâ form. In order to be more widely applicable it is crucial that more sophisticated techniques are used, and are presented in a way that is reproducible by engineers and verifiers alike. In this paper we demonstrate in detail two techniques that are used to increase the power of model checking using the model checker SPIN. The first of these is the use of embedded C code within Promela specifications, in order to accurately reflect robot movement. The second is to use abstraction together with a simulation relation to allow us to verify multiple environments simultaneously. We apply these techniques to a fairly simple system in which a robot moves about a fixed circular environment and learns to avoid obstacles. The learning algorithm is inspired by the way that insects learn to avoid obstacles in response to pain signals received from their antennae.

These methods perform a uniform sampling of the state space, which is needed to guarantee the algorithmâs completeness but does not necessarily lead to the most efficient solution. In previous works it has been shown that the use of heuristics to modify the sampling strategy could incur an improvement in the algorithm performance. However, these heuristics only apply to solve the shortest path-planning problem. Here we propose a framework that allows us to incorporate arbitrary heuristics to modify the sampling strategy according to the user requirements. This framework is based on âlearning from experienceâ. Specifically, we introduce a utility function that takes the contribution of the samples to the tree construction into account; sampling at locations of increased utility then becomes more frequent. The idea is realized by introducing an ant colony optimization concept in the RRT/RRT* algorithm and defining a novel utility function that permits trading off exploitation versus exploration of the state space. We also extend the algorithm to allow an anytime implementation. The scheme is validated with three scenarios: one populated with multiple rectangular obstacles, one consisting of a single narrow passage and a maze-like environment. We evaluate its performance in terms of the cost and time to find the first path, and in terms of the evolution of the path quality with the number of iterations.

The uncertain factors can be attributed either to the industrial robot itself (e.g., a mismatch of dynamics, mechanical defects such as backlash, etc.) or to the external environment (e.g., calibration errors, misalignment or perturbations of a workpiece, etc.). This paper proposes a systematic approach to implement high-performance position regulation under uncertainties on a general industrial robot (referred to as the main robot) with minimal or no manual teaching. The method is based on a coarse-to-fine strategy that involves configuring an add-on module for the main robotâs end effector. The add-on module consists of a 1000 Hz vision sensor and a high-speed actuator to compensate for accumulated uncertainties. The main robot only focuses on fast and coarse motion, with its trajectories automatically planned by image information from a static low-cost camera. Fast and accurate peg-and-hole alignment in one dimension was implemented as an application scenario by using a commercial parallel-link robot and an add-on compensation module with one degree of freedom (DoF). Experimental results yielded an almost 100% success rate for fast peg-in-hole manipulation (with regulation accuracy at about 0.1 mm) when the workpiece was randomly placed.

Accurate tracking whilst maintaining safety with respect to workspace obstacles.
Nowadays, programming an industrial manipulator is a complex and time-consuming activity, and this prevents industrial robots from being massively used in companies characterized by high production flexibility and rapidly changing products. The introduction of sensor-based lead-through programming approaches (where the operator manually guides the robot to teach new positions), instead, allows to increase the speed and reduce the complexity of the programming phase, yielding an effective solution to enhance flexibility. Nevertheless, some drawbacks arise, like for instance lack of accuracy, need to ensure the human operator safety, and need for force/torque sensors (the standard devices adopted for lead-through programming) that are expensive, fragile and difficult to integrate in the robot controller.

This paper presents a novel approach to lead-through robot programming. The proposed strategy does not rely on dedicated hardware since torques due to operator's forces are estimated using a model-based observer fed with joint position, joint velocity and motor current measures. On the basis of this information, the external forces applied to the manipulator are reconstructed. A voting system identifies the largest Cartesian component of the force/torque applied to the manipulator in order to obtain accurate lead-through programming via admittance control. Finally an optimization stage is introduced in order to track the joint position displacements computed by the admittance filter as much as possible, while enforcing obstacle avoidance constraints, actuation bounds and Tool Centre Point (TCP) operational space velocity limits. The proposed approach has been implemented and experimentally tested on an ABB dual-arm concept robot FRIDA.",NO,0,highlights estimation likely direction robot tcp positionalorientational displacement accurate tracking whilst maintaining safety respect workspace obstacles nowadays programming industrial manipulator complex timeconsuming activity prevents industrial robots massively used companies characterized high production flexibility rapidly changing products introduction sensorbased leadthrough programming approaches operator manually guides robot teach new positions instead allows increase speed reduce complexity programming phase yielding effective solution enhance flexibility nevertheless drawbacks arise like instance lack accuracy need ensure human operator safety need forcetorque sensors standard devices adopted leadthrough programming expensive fragile difficult integrate robot controller paper presents novel approach leadthrough robot programming proposed strategy rely dedicated hardware since torque due operator forces estimated using modelbased observer fed joint position joint velocity motor current measures basis information external forces applied manipulator reconstructed voting system identifies largest cartesian component forcetorque applied manipulator order obtain accurate leadthrough programming via admittance control finally optimization stage introduced order track joint position displacement computed admittance filter much possible enforcing obstacle avoidance constraints actuation bounds tool centre point tcp operational space velocity limits proposed approach implemented experimentally tested abb dualarm concept robot friday,accurate sensorless leadthrough programming lightweight robots structured environments

This approach is fully implemented and evaluated in an educational application model, called model of Mental Architecture DigitizedâAMD. In particular, performs user modeling by dynamically identifying and updating a student's knowledge level of all the concepts of the domain knowledge. The concept of AMD is based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) that are used to represent the dependences among the domain concepts. AMD uses fuzzy sets to represent a student's knowledge level as a subset of the domain knowledge. Thus, it combines fuzzy theory with the overlay model. Moreover, it employs a novel inference mechanism that dynamically updates user stereotypes using fuzzy sets. It should be noted that the overlay model and stereotypes constitute two widely used methods for user modeling. The gain from this novel combination is significant as a student level of knowledge is represented in a more realistic way by automatically modeling the learning or forgetting process of a student with respect to the FCMs and thus, the system can provide individualized adaptive advice. The transmission and retention of knowledge rests on the cognitive faculty of the concepts linked to it.

Well established methodologies, techniques and languages from the software domainâsuch as Object-Oriented Paradigm design, Unified Modelling Language, and multithreading programmingâare applied; and semiautomatic C-to-HDL translation tools and methods are used and compared.

The purpose of this paper is to design intelligent robots operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18- Ã 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously.

Design/methodology/approach

This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited.

Findings

Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots.

Developed a prototype laser weeding robot equipped with dual-gimbal laser pointers.

Two image processing algorithms were used to classify weeds and crops.

Test showed the weeding mean positional error was 1.97â¯mm with 97% hit rate.
To demonstrate the feasibility and improve the implementation of laser weeding, a prototype robot was built and equipped with machine vision and gimbal mounted laser pointers. The robot consisted of a mobile platform modified from a small commercial quad bike, a camera to detect the crop and weeds and two steerable gimbals controlling the laser pointers. Visible-one laser pointers were used to simulate the powerful laser trajectories. A colour segmentation algorithm was utilised to extract plants from the soil background; size estimation was used to differentiate crop from weeds; and an erosion and dilation algorithm was developed to separate objects that were touching. Conversely, another algorithm, which utilised shape descriptors, was able to distinguish plant species in non-touching status regardless of area difference. Next, in order to reduce route length and run time, a new path-planning algorithm for static weeding was proposed and tested. It was demonstrated to be more efficient especially when addressing a higher density of weeds. A model was then established to determine the optimal segmentation size, based on the route length for treatment. It was found that the segmentation algorithm has the potential to be widely used in fast path-planning for the travelling-salesman problem. Finally, performance tests in the indoor environments showed that the weeding mean positional error was 1.97â¯mm, with a 0.88â¯mm standard deviation. Another test indicated that with a laser traversal speed of 30â¯mm/s and a dwell time of 0.64â¯s per weed, it had a hit rate of 97%.",NO,0,highlights developed prototype laser wedding robot equipped dualgimbal laser pointers two image processing algorithms used classify weeds crops proposed efficient fast pathplanning method travellingsalesman problem established model optimal segmentation size target quantity test showed wedding mean positional error mm hit rate demonstrate feasibility improve implementation laser wedding prototype robot built equipped machine vision gimbal mounted laser pointers robot consisted mobile platform modified small commercial quad bike camera detect crop weeds two steerable gimbals controlling laser pointers visibleone laser pointers used simulate powerful laser trajectories colour segmentation algorithm utilised extract plants soil background size estimation used differentiate crop weeds erosion dilation algorithm developed separate objects touching conversely another algorithm utilised shape descriptors able distinguish plant species nontouching status regardless area difference next order reduce route length run time new pathplanning algorithm static wedding proposed tested demonstrated efficient especially addressing higher density weeds model established determine optimal segmentation size based route length treatment found segmentation algorithm potential widely used fast pathplanning travellingsalesman problem finally performance tests indoor environments showed wedding mean positional error mm mm standard deviation another test indicated laser traversal speed mms dwell time s per weed hit rate,development prototype robot fast pathplanning algorithm static laser wedding

Widespread acceptability of mobile service robots in daily life is hindered by robot's inability to navigate in crowded and dynamic human environments in a socially acceptable way that would guarantee human safety and comfort. In this paper, we propose an effective proactive social motion model (PSMM) that enables a mobile service robot to navigate safely and socially in crowded and dynamic environments. The proposed method considers not only human states (position, orientation, motion, field of view, and hand poses) relative to the robot but also social interactive information about human-object and human group interactions. This allows development of the PSMM that consists of elements of an extended social force model and a hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle technique. The PSMM is then combined with a path planning technique to generate a motion planning system that drives a mobile robot in a socially acceptable manner and produces respectful and polite behaviors akin to human movements.

In principle, planning operators can be hand-coded, but this is impractical for applications that involve many possible state transitions. An alternative is to learn them automatically from experience, which is most efficient when there is a human teacher. In this study, we propose a simple and efficient decision-making framework for this purpose. The robot executes its plan in a step-wise manner and any planning impasse produced by missing operators is resolved online by asking a human teacher for the next action to execute. Based on the observed state transitions, this approach rapidly generates the missing operators by evaluating the relevance of several causeâeffect alternatives in parallel using a probability estimate, which compensates for the high uncertainty that is inherent when learning from a small number of samples. We evaluated the validity of our approach in simulated and real environments, where it was benchmarked against previous methods. Humans learn in the same incremental manner, so we consider that our approach may be a better alternative to existing learning paradigms, which require offline learning, a significant amount of previous knowledge, or a large number of samples.",NO,0,inclusion robots society imminent service robots robots capable reliably manipulating objects daily lives combined artificial intelligence ai techniques planning decisionmaking allow machine determine task completed successfully perform decision making ai planning methods use set planning operators code state changes environment produced robotic action given specific goal planner searches best sequence planning operators ie best plan leads state space satisfy goal principle planning operators handcoded impractical applications involve many possible state transitions alternative learn automatically experience efficient human teacher study propose simple efficient decisionmaking framework purpose robot executes plan stepwise manner planning impasse produced missing operators resolved online asking human teacher next action execute based observed state transitions approach rapidly generates missing operators evaluating relevance several becauseeffect alternatives parallel using probability estimate compensate high uncertainty inherent learning small number samples evaluated validity approach simulated real environments benchmarked previous methods humans learn incremental manner consider approach may better alternative existing learning paradigms require offline learning significant amount previous knowledge large number samples,efficient interactive decisionmaking framework robotic applications

For time-critical cargo delivery tasks, UAVs need to be able to quickly navigate their environments and deliver suspended payloads with bounded load displacement. As a constraint balancing task for joint UAV-suspended load system dynamics, this task poses a challenge. This article presents a reinforcement learning approach for aerial cargo delivery tasks in environments with static obstacles. We first learn a minimal residual oscillations task policy in obstacle-free environments using a specifically designed feature vector for value function approximation that allows generalization beyond the training domain. The method works in continuous state and discrete action spaces. Since planning for aerial cargo requires very large action space (over 106 actions) that is impractical for learning, we define formal conditions for a class of robotics problems where learning can occur in a simplified problem space and successfully transfer to a broader problem space. Exploiting these guarantees and relying on the discrete action space, we learn the swing-free policy in a subspace several orders of magnitude smaller, and later develop a method for swing-free trajectory planning along a path. As an extension to tasks in environments with static obstacles where the load displacement needs to be bounded throughout the trajectory, sampling-based motion planning generates collision-free paths. Next, a reinforcement learning agent transforms these paths into trajectories that maintain the bound on the load displacement while following the collision-free path in a timely manner. We verify the approach both in simulation and in experiments on a quadrotor with suspended load and verify the method's safety and feasibility through a demonstration where a quadrotor delivers an open container of liquid to a human subject. The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, this article presents a solution to a challenging, and vital problem of planning a constraint-balancing task for an inherently unstable non-linear system in the presence of obstacles.

Background and objectives

Disk diffusion testing, known as antibiogram, is widely applied in microbiology to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. The measurement of the diameter of the zone of growth inhibition of microorganisms around the antimicrobial disks in the antibiogram is frequently performed manually by specialists using a ruler. This is a time-consuming and error-prone task that might be simplified using automated or semi-automated inhibition zone readers. However, most readers are usually expensive instruments with embedded software that require significant changes in laboratory design and workflow.

Methods

Based on the workflow employed by specialists to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms, we have designed a software tool that, from images of disk diffusion tests, semi-automatises the process. Standard computer vision techniques are employed to achieve such an automatisation.

Results

We present AntibiogramJ, a user-friendly and open-source software tool to semi-automatically determine, measure and categorise inhibition zones of images from disk diffusion tests. AntibiogramJ is implemented in Java and deals with images captured with any device that incorporates a camera, including digital cameras and mobile phones. The fully automatic procedure of AntibiogramJ for measuring inhibition zones achieves an overall agreement of 87% with an expert microbiologist; moreover, AntibiogramJ includes features to easily detect when the automatic reading is not correct and fix it manually to obtain the correct result.

Optimization-based methods can explicitly optimize a trajectory by leveraging prior knowledge of the system and have been used in various applications such as collision avoidance. However, these methods often require a hand-coded cost function in order to achieve the desired behavior. Specifying such cost function for a complex desired behavior, e.g., disentangling a rope, is a nontrivial task that is often even infeasible. Learning from demonstration (LfD) methods offer an alternative way to program robot motion. LfD methods are less dependent on analytical models and instead learn the behavior of experts implicitly from the demonstrated trajectories. However, the problem of adapting the demonstrations to new situations, e.g., avoiding newly introduced obstacles, has not been fully investigated in the literature. In this letter, we present a motion planning framework that combines the advantages of optimization-based and demonstration-based methods. We learn a distribution of trajectories demonstrated by human experts and use it to guide the trajectory optimization process.

Generally, it is a two step process: (i) generate a global route to the goal and (ii) local motion of the robot along the route. The focus of this paper is on the first part of the process. Some common techniques used are based on heuristic search algorithms that obtain (sub)optimal paths by usually exploiting a rather simplistic terrain representation. Then, the paths generated hardly take into account relevant terrain features, which leads to potentially unsafe paths in realistic environments. This paper presents two contributions: a mathematical formulation for any DTM that can be used by heuristic search algorithms, and a path planning algorithm that generates candidate paths that are safer than the ones obtained by previous approaches. This algorithm, called 3Dana, considers different parameters to maximize the path quality: the maximum slope allowed by the robot and the heading changes during the path.

The objective of this research work is to propose a weed detecting robotic model for sugarcane fields that uses a fuzzy real time classifier on leaf textures. The differentiation between weed and crop and weed removal are the two challenging tasks for the farmers especially in the Indian sugarcane cultivation scenario. The automatic weed detection and removal becomes a vital task for improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the agricultural processes.

Adaptive behavior planning, prediction and reasoning are achieved between tasks, environment, and threats. Through building a novel episode model and introducing the activation and stimulation mechanism of state neurons, the framework of an episodic memory-driving Markov decision process (EM-MDP) is proposed for incremental self-learning of robotic experience and cognitive behavior planning. Two main challenges in robot behavior control under uncertainty are addressed: high computational complexity and perceptual aliasing. The approach for robotic global planning and behaviors sequence prediction based on the EM-MDP is developed utilizing neuron synaptic potential. A local behavioral planning method based on risk function and feasible paths is employed to achieve path optimization and behavior reasoning under the condition of imperfect memory. Robot can evaluate the past events sequence, predict the current state, and plan the desired behaviors. The proposed method is evaluated in several real-life environments for a mobile robot system.

Here, the nonlinear and constrained motion and measurement models in an MRS are incorporated to achieve an accurate state estimation algorithm based on nonlinear Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) and a tracking control method based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC).

However, in order to take advantage of natural language, a series of challenges must first be overcome. These challenges include the need to a) generalize learnt tasks to novel scenarios without retraining, b) resolve problems encountered during task execution, and c) derive implicit information from knowledge about the domain. To solve these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach to learning complex hierarchical tasks through natural language instruction, which not only allows learnt tasks to be generalized to novel situations without the need for retraining, but also enables an agent to derive implicit information from domain knowledge. Additionally, the approach presented in this paper enables the agent to infer task properties, such as preconditions and effects, directly from the explanation of the task flow. The authors validate the approach by demonstrating an implementation of the algorithms both on a simulated agent, as well as a Baxter robot. In each case, the agent is provided with a small set of primitive tasks for manipulating its workspace.

Searching task remains one of several research challenges due to the fact that the input space grows exponentially with the increase of program size, and different programs may have very different structures. The challenge is compounded in a cyber-physical system or cloud-based Internet of Things environment. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic search algorithm, which analyzes the program execution history and uses the refined history information to inform the search. This paper is based on the observation that the branch and input history generated during dynamic symbolic execution can help memorize the explored input space, and infer the partial structure of the program. With a summarized branch history, the proposed heuristic search makes informed (and better) decisions about which input area to search next for better efficiency. To evaluate the search algorithm, we implement the core DSE engine, integrated with modules to perform execution history collection and analysis. To make our method practical, we incorporate taint analysis and constraint solving statistics to guide the search algorithm.

Though it satisfies the requirement of quick response to usersâ commands and environmental changes, learning real-time search (LRTS) suffers from the heuristic depressions where agents behave irrationally. There have introduced several effective solutions, such as state abstractions. This paper combines LRTS and encoded quad-tree abstraction which represent the search space in multiresolutions. When exploring the environments, agents are enabled to locally repair the quad-tree models and incrementally refine the spatial cognition. By virtue of the idea of state aggregation and heuristic generalization, our EQ LRTS (encoded quad-tree based LRTS) possesses the ability of quickly escaping from heuristic depressions with less state revisitations. Experiments and analysis show that (a) our encoding principle for quad-trees is a much more memory-efficient method than other data structures expressing quad-trees, (b) EQ LRTS differs a lot in several characteristics from classical PR LRTS which represent the space and refine the paths hierarchically, and (c) EQ LRTS substantially reduces the planning amount and curtails heuristic updates compared with LRTS on uniform cells.",NO,0,context robot navigation game ai realtime search extensively used undertake motion planning though satisfies requirement quick response users commands environmental changes learning realtime search arts suffers heuristic depressions agents behave irrationally introduced several effective solutions state abstraction paper combines arts encoded quadtree abstraction represent search space multiresolutions exploring environments agents enabled locally repair quadtree models incrementally refine spatial cognition virtue idea state aggregation heuristic generalization eq arts encoded quadtree based arts possesses ability quickly escaping heuristic depressions less state revisitations experiments analysis show encoding principle quadtrees much memoryefficient method data structures expressing quadtrees b eq arts differs lot several characteristics classical pr arts represent space refine paths hierarchically c eq arts substantially reduces planning amount curtains heuristic updates compared arts uniform cells,escaping depressions arts based incremental refinement encoded quadtrees

A Service Oriented Architecture with Web Service interface added to SimSphere.

SimSphere becomes now suitable for HPC use.

Developments vital in its future use as standalone tool and for its synergy with EO data.
SimSphere is a land biosphere model that provides a mathematical representation of vertical âviewsâ of the physical mechanisms controlling Earth's energy and mass transfers in the soil/vegetation/atmosphere continuum. Herein, we present recent advancements introduced to SimSphere code, aiming at making its use more integrated to the automation of processes within High Performance Computing (HPC) that allows using the model at large scale. In particular, a new interface to the model is presented, so-called âSimSphere-SOAâ which forms a command line land biosphere tool, a Web Service interface and a parameters verification facade that offers a standardised environment for specification execution and result retrieval of a typical model simulation based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). SimSphere-SOA library can now execute various simulations in parallel. This allows exploitation of the tool in a simple and efficient way in comparison to the currently distributed approach. In SimSphere-SOA, an Application Programming Interface (API) is also provided to execute simulations that can be publicly consumed. Finally this API is exported as a Web Service for remotely executing simulations through web based tools.

Virtualized multicore contention - aware performance prediction model.

Virtual machine contention sensitivity and intensity features collection.

â¢

Quantify the precise levels of performance degradation between VMs.
Multicore systems are widely deployed in both the embedded and the high end computing infrastructures. However, traditional virtualization systems can not effectively isolate shared micro architectural resources among virtual machines (VMs) running on multicore systems. CPU and memory intensive VMs contending for these resources will lead to serious performance interference, which makes virtualization systems less efficient and VM performance less stable. In this paper, we propose a contention-aware performance prediction model on the virtualized multicore systems to quantify the performance degradation of VMs. First, we identify the performance interference factors and design synthetic micro-benchmarks to obtain VMâs contention sensitivity and intensity features that are correlated with VM performance degradation. Second, based on the contention features, we build VM performance prediction model using machine learning techniques to quantify the precise levels of performance degradation. The proposed model can be used to optimize VM performance on multicore systems. Our experimental results show that the performance prediction model achieves high accuracy and the mean absolute error is 2.83%.",NO,0,highlights virtualized multicore contention aware performance prediction model virtual machine contention sensitivity intensity features collection quantify precise levels performance degradation vs multicore systems widely deployed embedded high end computing infrastructures however traditional virtualization systems effectively isolate shared micro architectural resources among virtual machines vs running multicore systems cpu memory intensive vs contending resources lead serious performance interference makes virtualization systems less efficient vm performance less stable paper propose contentionaware performance prediction model virtualized multicore systems quantify performance degradation vs first identify performance interference factors design synthetic microbenchmarks obtain vs contention sensitivity intensity features correlated vm performance degradation second based contention features build vm performance prediction model using machine learning techniques quantify precise levels performance degradation proposed model used optimize vm performance multicore systems experimental results show performance prediction model achieves high accuracy mean absolute error,precise contentionaware performance prediction virtualized multicore system

241,10.1108/IR-06-2018-0120,,Application of mixed reality in robot manipulator programming,ar,Neves J.,"University of Coimbra, Centre for Mechanical Engineering, Materials and Processes",Industrial Robot,Journal,"Purpose

Mixed reality is expanding in the industrial market and several companies in various fields are adapting this set of technologies for various purposes, such as optimizing processes, improving the programming tasks and promoting the interactivity of their products with the users, or even improving teaching or training. Robotics is another area that can benefit from these recent technologies. In fact, most of the current and futuristic robotic applications, namely, the areas related to advanced manufacturing tasks (e.g. additive-manufacturing, collaborative robotics, etc.), require new technics to actually perceive the result of several actions, including programming tasks, anticipate trajectories, visualize the motion and related information, interface with programmers and users and several other humanâmachine interfaces. Consequently, this paper aims to explain a new concept of humanâmachine interfaces aiming to improve the interaction between advanced users and industrial robotic work cells.

Design/methodology/approach

The presented concept uses two different applications (apps) developed to explore the advanced features of the Microsoft HoloLens device. The objectives of the project reported in this paper are to optimize robot paths, just by allowing the advanced user to adjust the selected path through the mixed reality environment, and create new paths, just by allowing the advanced user to insert points in the mixed reality environment, correct them as needed, connect them using a certain type of motion, parametrize them (in terms of velocity, motion precision, etc.) and command them to the robot controller.

Findings

The solutions demonstrated in this paper show how mixed reality can be used to allow users, with limited programming experience, to fully use the robotics fields. They also show clearly that the integration of the mixed reality technology in the current robot systems will be a turning point in reducing the complexity for end-users.

Research limitations/implications

There are two challenges in the developed applications. The first relates to the robot tool identification, which is very sensitive to lighting conditions or to very complex robot tools. This can result in positioning errors when the software shows the path in the mixed reality scene. The paper presents solutions to overcome this problem. Another unattended challenge is associated with handling the robot singularities when adjusting or creating new paths. Ongoing work is concentrated in creating mechanisms that prevent the end-user to create paths that contain unreachable points or paths that are not feasible because of bad motion parameters.

Practical implications

This paper demonstrates the utilization of mixed reality device to improve the tasks of programming and commanding manufacturing work cells based on industrial robots [see video in (Pires et al., 2018)]. As the presented devices and robot cells are the basis for Industry 4.0 objectives, this demonstration has a vast field of application in the near future, positively influencing the way complex applications, that require much close cooperation between humans and machines, are thought, planned and built. The paper presents two different applications fully ready to use in industrial environments. These applications are scientific experiments designed to demonstrate the principles and technologies of mixed reality applied to industrial robotics, namely, for improving the programming task.

Social implications

Although the HoloLens device opens outstanding new areas for robot command and programming, it is still expensive and somehow heavy for everyday use. Consequently, this opens an opportunity window to combine these devices with other mobile devices, such as tablets and phones, building applications that take advantage of their combined features.

Originality/value

The paper presents two different applications fully ready to use in industrial environments. These applications are scientific experiments designed to demonstrate the principles and technologies of mixed reality applied to industrial robotics, namely, for improving the programming task. The first application is about path visualization, i.e. enables the user to visualize, in a mixed reality environment, any path preplanned for the robot cell. With this feature, the advanced user can follow the robot path, identify problems, associate any difficulty in the final product with a particular issue in the robot paths, anticipate execution problems with impact on the final product quality, etc. This is particularly important for not only advanced applications, but also for cases where the robot path results from a CAD package (in an offline fashion). The second application consists of a graphical path manipulation procedure that allows the advanced user to create and optimize a robot path. Just by exploring this feature, the end-user can adjust any path obtained from any programming method, using the mixed reality approach to guide (visually) the path manipulation procedure. It can also create a completely new path using a process of graphical insertion of point positions and paths into the mixed reality scene.

The only factor restricting the efficiency of this FA algorithm is the need of having balanced exploration and exploitation while searching for the global optima in the search-space. This balance can be established by tuning the two inherent control parameters of FA. One is the randomization parameter and another is light absorption coefficient, over iterations, either experimentally or by an automatic adaptive strategy. This paper aims at the later by proposing an improvised FA which involves the Q-learning framework within itself. In this proposed Q-learning induced FA (QFA), the optimal parameter values for each firefly of a population are learnt by the Q-learning strategy during the learning phase and applied thereafter during execution. The proposed algorithm has been simulated on fifteen benchmark functions suggested in the CEC 2015 competition. In addition, the proposed algorithm's superiority is tested by conducting the Friedman test, ImanâDavenport and Bonferroni Dunn test.

Exploits context between objects to improve object recognition results.
A world model representing the elements in a robotâs environment needs to maintain a correspondence between the objects being observed and their internal representations, which is known as the anchoring problem. Anchoring is a key aspect for an intelligent robot operation, since it enables high-level functions such as task planning and execution. This work presents an anchoring system that continually integrates new observations from a 3D object recognition algorithm into a probabilistic world model. Our system takes advantage of the contextual relations inherent to human-made spaces in order to improve the classification results of the baseline object recognition system. To achieve that, the system builds a graph-based world model containing the objects in the scene (both in the current and previously perceived observations), which is exploited by a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) in order to leverage contextual information during recognition. The world model also enables the system to exploit information about objects beyond the current field of view of the robot sensors. Most importantly, this is done in an online fashion, overcoming both the disadvantages of single-shot recognition systems (e.g., limited sensor aperture) and offline recognition systems that require prior registration of all frames of a scene (e.g., dynamic scenes, unsuitability for plan-based robot control). We also propose a novel way to include the outcome of local object recognition methods in the PGM, which results in a decrease in the usually high model learning complexity and an increase in the system performance. The system performance has been assessed with a dataset collected by a mobile robot from restaurant-like settings, obtaining positive results for both its data association and object recognition capabilities.

Some teaching tools focus on the function of making robot motion in detail, and it assumes that the adjustment of the whole workflow including system layout using the real work environment. For this reason, the environmental expression is not sufficient for the above purpose.

245,10.1177/0278364918781001,,Data-driven planning via imitation learning,ar,Choudhury S.,Carnegie Mellon University,International Journal of Robotics Research,Journal,"Robot planning is the process of selecting a sequence of actions that optimize for a task=specific objective. For instance, the objective for a navigation task would be to find collision-free paths, whereas the objective for an exploration task would be to map unknown areas. The optimal solutions to such tasks are heavily influenced by the implicit structure in the environment, i.e. the configuration of objects in the world. State-of-the-art planning approaches, however, do not exploit this structure, thereby expending valuable effort searching the action space instead of focusing on potentially good actions. In this paper, we address the problem of enabling planners to adapt their search strategies by inferring such good actions in an efficient manner using only the information uncovered by the search up until that time. We formulate this as a problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty where at a given iteration a planning policy must map the state of the search to a planning action. Unfortunately, the training process for such partial-information-based policies is slow to converge and susceptible to poor local minima. Our key insight is that if we could fully observe the underlying world map, we would easily be able to disambiguate between good and bad actions. We hence present a novel data-driven imitation learning framework to efficiently train planning policies by imitating a clairvoyant oracle: an oracle that at train time has full knowledge about the world map and can compute optimal decisions. We leverage the fact that for planning problems, such oracles can be efficiently computed and derive performance guarantees for the learnt policy. We examine two important domains that rely on partial-information-based policies: informative path planning and search-based motion planning. We validate the approach on a spectrum of environments for both problem domains, including experiments on a real UAV, and show that the learnt policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Our framework is able to train policies that achieve up to 39% more reward than state-of-the art information-gathering heuristics and a 70Ã speedup as compared with A* on search-based planning problems.

Our main insight in this paper is that a robotâs path planning times can be significantly reduced if it can refer to previous maneuvers it used to avoid obstacles during earlier missions, and adapt that information to avoid obstacles during its current navigation. We propose an online path planning algorithm called LearnerRRT that utilizes a pattern matching technique called Sample Consensus Initial Alignment (SAC-IA) in combination with an experience-based learning technique to adapt obstacle boundary patterns encountered in previous environments to the current scenario followed by corresponding adaptations in the obstacle-avoidance paths. Our proposed algorithm LearnerRRT works as a learning-based reactive path planning technique which enables robots to improve their overall path planning performance by locally improving maneuvers around commonly encountered obstacle patterns by accessing previously accumulated environmental information. We have conducted several experiments in simulations and hardware to verify the performance of the LearnerRRT algorithm and compared it with a state-of-the-art sampling-based planner.

Robot imitation frameworks aim to simplify and reduce times of robot programming by allowing users to program directly through action demonstrations. In classical robot imitation frameworks, actions are modelled using joint or Cartesian space trajectories. They accurately describe actions where geometrical characteristics are relevant, such as fixed trajectories from one pose to another. Other features, such as visual ones, are not always well represented with these pure geometrical approaches. Continuous Goal-Directed Actions (CGDA) is an alternative to these conventional methods, as it encodes actions as changes of any selected feature that can be extracted from the environment. As a consequence of this, the robot joint trajectories for execution must be fully computed to comply with this feature-agnostic encoding. This is achieved using Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), which usually requires too many evaluations to perform this evolution step in the actual robot. The current strategies involve performing evaluations in a simulated environment, transferring only the final joint trajectory to the actual robot. Smart City applications involve working in highly dynamic and complex environments, where having a precise model is not always achievable. Our goal is to study the tractability of performing these evaluations directly in a real-world scenario. Two different approaches to reduce the number of evaluations using EA, are proposed and compared. In the first approach, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based methods have been studied and compared within the CGDA framework: naÃ¯ve PSO, Fitness Inheritance PSO (FI-PSO), and Adaptive Fuzzy Fitness Granulation with PSO (AFFG-PSO). The second approach studied the introduction of geometrical and velocity constraints within the CGDA framework.

However, the efficient prediction models often require repetitive training, which leads to a higher training time overheads, and greatly affects the widespread utilization of the technology. The existing approaches in the prediction model construction often use random sample search strategy, which easily lead to data redundancy. In addition, due to the effect of run-time noises, the sample program is subjected to a fixed number of repetitive observations. However, in the case there is very little noises, the repetitive observations will result in a serious waste of iterative compilation time overheads. Therefore, how to effectively collect the optimal prediction model samples and choose the appropriate sample observations number are the key problem of reducing the iterative compilation overheads. We propose a low overheads iterative compilation optimization parameters prediction model ALIC. First, we describe the target programs by static-dynamic features representation based on feature-class relevance, and construct an initial optimization prediction model by the classifier. Then we use a dynamic number of sample observations strategy for each sample. The most profitable sample from the candidate samples set is selected and marked, each mark is equivalent to increase the number of sample observations. Finally, the optimization prediction model is constructed based on the intermediate prediction model that learns candidate samples actively.

The objective of this work is to present gumpy, a new free and open source Python toolbox designed for hybrid brainâcomputer interface (BCI). Approach. Gumpy provides state-of-the-art algorithms and includes a rich selection of signal processing methods that have been employed by the BCI community over the last 20 years. In addition, a wide range of classification methods that span from classical machine learning algorithms to deep neural network models are provided. Gumpy can be used for both EEG and EMG biosignal analysis, visualization, real-time streaming and decoding. Results. The usage of the toolbox was demonstrated through two different offline example studies, namely movement prediction from EEG motor imagery, and the decoding of natural grasp movements with the applied finger forces from surface EMG (sEMG) signals. Additionally, gumpy was used for real-time control of a robot arm using steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) as well as for real-time prosthetic hand control using sEMG. Overall, obtained results with the gumpy toolbox are comparable or better than previously reported results on the same datasets. Significance. Gumpy is a free and open source software, which allows end-users to perform online hybrid BCIs and provides different techniques for processing and decoding of EEG and EMG signals.

Multiple successful demonstrations where the adapt- ability, scalability, and reconfigure-ability of the approach are investigated by deploying it in various real industrial settings.
During the past decades, the increasing need for more flexible and agile manufacturing equipment has spawned a growing interest in collaborative robots. Contrary to traditional industrial robots, collaborative robots are intended for operating alongside the production personnel in dynamic or semi-structured human environments. To cope with the environment and workflow of humans, new programming and control methods are needed compared to those of traditional industrial robots. This paper presents a task-level programming software tool allowing robotic novices to program industrial tasks on a collaborative robot. The tool called Skill Based System (SBS) is founded on the concept of robot skills, which are parameterizable and task-related actions of the robot. Task programming is conducted by first sequencing skills followed by an online parameterization performed using kinesthetic teaching. Through several user studies, SBS is found to enable robotic novices to program industrial tasks.

In this paper, we focus on programming the industrial robot for assembly tasks by parsing the human demonstration into a series of assembly skills and compiling the skill to the robot executables. To achieve this goal, an identification system using multimodal information to recognize the assembly skill, called MASD, is proposed including: 1) an initial learning stage using a hierarchical model to recognize the action by considering the features from action-object effect, gesture, and trajectory and 2) a retrospective thinking stage using a segmentation method to cut the continuous demonstrations into multiple assembly skills optimally. Using MASD, the demonstration of assembly tasks can be explained with high accuracy in real time, driving a hypothesis that a PBD system on the top of MASD can be extended to more realistic assembly tasks beyond pure positional moving and picking. In experiments, the skill identification module is used to recognize the five kinds of assembly skills in demonstrations of both single and multiple assembly skills, and outperforms the comparative action identification methods. Besides integrated with the MASD, the PBD system can generate the program based on the demonstration and successfully enable an ABB industrial robotic arm simulator to assemble a flashlight and a switch, verifying the initial hypothesis. Note to Practitioners-In the conventional robotized automation, the key role of the robot mainly owes to its capacity for repeating a wide variety of tasks with high speed and accuracy in long term, with a cost of days to months of programming for deployment.

Boolean methods such as satisfiability (SAT) solving are successful in tackling large combinatorial search problems for the design and verification of hardware and software components. On the other hand, problems in control, communications, signal processing, and machine learning often rely on convex programming as a powerful solution engine. However, despite their strengths, neither approach would work in isolation for CPSs. In this paper, we present a new satisfiability modulo convex programming (SMC) framework that integrates SAT solving and convex optimization to efficiently reason about Boolean and convex constraints at the same time. We exploit the properties of a class of logic formulas over Boolean and nonlinear real predicates, termed monotone satisfiability modulo convex formulas, whose satisfiability can be checked via a finite number of convex programs. Following the lazy satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) paradigm, we develop a new decision procedure for monotone SMC formulas, which coordinates SAT solving and convex programming to provide a satisfying assignment or determine that the formula is unsatisfiable. A key step in our coordination scheme is the efficient generation of succinct infeasibility proofs for inconsistent constraints that can support conflict-driven learning and accelerate the search.

A new software framework allows us to test and compare diverse RL algorithms.
Mobile robots are increasingly being employed for performing complex tasks in dynamic environments. Those tasks can be either explicitly programmed by an engineer or learned by means of some automatic learning method, which improves the adaptability of the robot and reduces the effort of setting it up. In this sense, reinforcement learning (RL) methods are recognized as a promising tool for a machine to learn autonomously how to do tasks that are specified in a relatively simple manner. However, the dependency between these methods and the particular task to learn is a well-known problem that has strongly restricted practical implementations in robotics so far. Breaking this barrier would have a significant impact on these and other intelligent systems; in particular, having a core method that requires little tuning effort for being applicable to diverse tasks would boost their autonomy in learning and self-adaptation capabilities. In this paper we present such a practical core implementation of RL, which enables the learning process for multiple robotic tasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods, we introduce a novel approach for action selection, called Q-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), that takes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical variables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, robot pose, etc.), thus experienced sets of states accelerate the decision-making process of unexplored or rarely-explored states. Intensive experiments with both real and simulated robots, carried out with the software framework also introduced here, show that our implementation is able to learn different robotic tasks without tuning the learning method. They also suggest that the combination of true online SARSA(Î») (TOSL) with QBIASSR can outperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks. All of these are promising results towards the possibility of learning much more complex tasks autonomously by a robotic agent.",NO,0,highlights valueiterationbased algorithm effectively applied multiple robotic tasks novel efficient method improves softmax action selection structuring inputs resulted rl method improves modelfree solutions minimal task knowledge compatible highdimensional rl low computational cost new software framework allows us test compare diverse rl algorithms mobile robots increasingly employed performing complex tasks dynamic environments tasks either explicitly programmed engineer learned means automatic learning method improves adaptability robot reduces effort setting up sense reinforcement learning rl methods recognized promising tool machine learn autonomously tasks specified relatively simple manner however dependency methods particular task learn wellknown problem strongly restricted practical implementations robotics far breaking barrier would significant impact intelligent systems particular core method requires little tuning effort applicable diverse tasks would boost autonomy learning selfadaptation capabilities paper present practical core implementation rl enables learning process multiple robotic tasks minimal pertask tuning none based value iteration methods introduce novel approach action selection called biased softmax regression qbiassr takes advantage structure state space attending physical variables involved eg distances obstacles robot pose etc thus experienced sets states accelerate decisionmaking process unexplored rarelyexplored states intensive experiments real simulated robots carried software framework also introduced show implementation able learn different robotic tasks without tuning learning method also suggest combination true online sara tool qbiassr outperform existing rl core algorithms lowdimensional robotic tasks promising results towards possibility learning much complex tasks autonomously robotic agent,towards common implementation reinforcement learning multiple robotic tasks

In this paper, we present an approach to the problem of Robot Learning from Demonstration (RLfD) in a dynamic environment, i.e. an environment whose state changes throughout the course of performing a task. RLfD mostly has been successfully exploited only in non-varying environments to reduce the programming time and cost, e.g. fixed manufacturing workspaces. Non-conventional production lines necessitate HumanâRobot Collaboration (HRC) implying robots and humans must work in shared workspaces. In such conditions, the robot needs to avoid colliding with the objects that are moved by humans in the workspace. Therefore, not only is the robot: (i) required to learn a task model from demonstrations; but also, (ii) must learn a control policy to avoid a stationary obstacle. Furthermore, (iii) it needs to build a control policy from demonstration to avoid moving obstacles. Here, we present an incremental approach to RLfD addressing all these three problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RLfD approach, by a series of pick-and-place experiments by an ABB YuMi robot.

The use of a physical robot is an opportunity for students with disabilities.
Today it is almost impossible to spend a single day without depending on an information system, a computer or any other form of computation. Though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. In 1967, Logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic Turtle. LOGO was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. From LOGO, many followed. Scratch and Lego Mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. Both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. We propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind LOGO by updating it with state of the art technologies. Phogo combines Python, Arduino and 3D printing into a low cost robot that is easy to build and control. The robot has a pen to draw shapes and can be commanded from a computer via a wireless link that is transparent to the students. The use of a physical robot can make programming more accessible for students with disabilities. The open and maker philosophies behind Phogo makes it more interesting as students will be able to access and study the electronic components. The textual programing language can be a long life companion for the students.

Knowledge representation used in ADC is easy to understand by humans.
A truly autonomous artificial intelligence agent should be able to drive its own learning process. That is, decide what to explore and what to learn, identifying what constitutes potential useful data as examples of concepts or what strategy to follow to solve a new task. Different efforts have been developed in machine learning towards this aim. Approaches that introduce new concepts, like predicate invention in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) techniques, normally require the selection of examples by the user. Techniques that learn behavior policies through exploration like Reinforcement Learning (RL) with intrinsic motivation, to guide the agent into interesting areas to discover new goals, assume that all the states and actions are predefined in advance. In this paper, we describe a system, called ADC, that combines techniques from ILP with predicate invention and RL with intrinsic motivation to discover new concepts, states and actions to learn behavior policies. ADC drives its own learning process, collecting its own examples for autonomously learning concepts. These new concepts can be used to describe its environment and define new states and actions used to learn behaviors to solve tasks.

Currently, tool use must be pre-programmed by a human. However, this is a difficult task and can be helped if the robot is able to learn how to use a tool by itself. Most of the work in tool use learning by a robot is done using a feature-based representation. Despite many successful results, this representation is limited in the types of tools and tasks that can be handled. Furthermore, the complex relationship between a tool and other world objects cannot be captured easily. Relational learning methods have been proposed to overcome these weaknesses [1, 2]. However, they have only been evaluated in a sensor-less simulation to avoid the complexities and uncertainties of the real world.

Deep reinforcement learning methods partially alleviate this problem in that they can dispense with hand-crafted features for the state representation and do not need pre-computed dynamics. However, they often use prior information in the task definition in the form of shaping rewards which guide the robot toward goal state areas but require engineering or human supervision and can lead to sub-optimal behavior. In this work we consider a complex robot reaching task with a large range of initial object positions and initial arm positions and propose a new learning approach with minimal supervision. Inspired by developmental robotics, our method consists of a weakly-supervised stage-wise procedure of three tasks. First, the robot learns to fixate the object with a 2-camera system. Second, it learns hand-eye coordination by learning to fixate its end-effector. Third, using the knowledge acquired in the previous steps, it learns to reach the object at different positions and from a large set of initial robot joint angles.

This paper presents a path planning approach for autonomous mobile robots in a complex dynamic indoor environment, where the dynamic pattern of obstacles will not drastically affect the performance of RL models. Two independent modules, collision avoidance without considering the goal position and goal-seeking without considering obstacles avoidance, are trained independently using artificial neural networks and RL to obtain their best control policies.

This book is the first technical overview of autonomous vehicles written for a general computing and engineering audience. The authors share their practical experiences of creating autonomous vehicle systems. These systems are complex, consisting of three major subsystems: (1) algorithms for localization, perception, and planning and control; (2) client systems, such as the robotics operating system and hardware platform; and (3) the cloud platform, which includes data storage, simulation, high-definition (HD) mapping, and deep learning model training. The algorithm subsystem extracts meaningful information from sensor raw data to understand its environment and make decisions about its actions. The client subsystem integrates these algorithms to meet real-time and reliability requirements. The cloud platform provides offline computing and storage capabilities for autonomous vehicles. Using the cloud platform, we are able to test new algorithms and update the HD mapâplus, train better recognition, tracking, and decision models.

This book consists of nine chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of autonomous vehicle systems; Chapter 2 focuses on localization technologies; Chapter 3 discusses traditional techniques used for perception; Chapter 4 discusses deep learning based techniques for perception; Chapter 5 introduces the planning and control sub-system, especially prediction and routing technologies; Chapter 6 focuses on motion planning and feedback control of the planning and control subsystem; Chapter 7 introduces reinforcement learning-based planning and control; Chapter 8 delves into the details of client systems design; and Chapter 9 provides the details of cloud platforms for autonomous driving.

This book should be useful to students, researchers, and practitioners alike. Whether you are an undergraduate or a graduate student interested in autonomous driving, you will find herein a comprehensive overview of the whole autonomous vehicle technology stack. If you are an autonomous driving practitioner, the many practical techniques introduced in this book will be of interest to you. Researchers will also find plenty of references for an effective, deeper exploration of the various technologies.

In this robot team, the roles are explicitly divided. The carrier oversees the transportation, deployment, and retrieval of the rovers, whereas the rovers are responsible for performing tasks such as reconnaissance and search and rescue. We aim to use this robot team to minimize the maximum amount of time that each rover requires to reach a given task location. However, only a few studies have addressed pathplanning for robot teams. To generate an efficient path, the mobility and energy limitations of the robots and the obstacles in the environment must be considered. Because considering all possible paths on a graph is equivalent to solving a combinatorial optimization problem, we suggest a computationally efficient heuristic algorithm, which combines a greedy clustering method with a probabilistic roadmap. The proposed method is verified through simulations.

In such scenarios, tactile and proprioceptive feedback can be leveraged for task completion. We present an approach for real-time haptic perception and decision-making for a haptics-driven, functional contour-following task: the closure of a ziplock bag. This task is challenging for robots because the bag is deformable, transparent, and visually occluded by artificial fingertip sensors that are also compliant. A deep neural net classifier was trained to estimate the state of a zipper within a robot's pinch grasp.

The C-MAB learner outperformed a benchmark Q-learner by more efficiently exploring the state-action space while learning a hard-to-code task. The learned C-MAB policy was tested with novel ziplock bag scenarios and contours (wire, rope).

Stencils are embarrassingly parallel, therefore fit on modern hardware such as Graphic Processing Units perfectly. Although stencil computations have been extensively studied, optimizing them for increasingly diverse hardware remains challenging. Domain-specific Languages (DSLs) have raised the programming abstraction and offer good performance; however, this method places the burden on DSL implementers to write almost full-fledged parallelizing compilers and optimizers.

Lift has recently emerged as a promising approach to achieve performance portability by using a small set of reusable parallel primitives that DSL or library writers utilize. Liftâs key novelty is in its encoding of optimizations as a system of extensible rewrite rules which are used to explore the optimization space.

This article demonstrates how complex multi-dimensional stencil code and optimizations are expressed using compositions of simple 1D Lift primitives and rewrite rules. We introduce two optimizations that provide high performance for stencils in particular: classical overlapped tiling for multi-dimensional stencils and 2.5D tiling specifically for 3D stencils.

Biased data can cause an effective degradation of link recovery approaches.

â¢

DeepLink outperformed a link recovery approach by 4.6% in F-measure.
The links between issues in an issue-tracking system and commits resolving the issues in a version control system are important for a variety of software engineering tasks (e.g., bug prediction, bug localization and feature location). However, only a small portion of such links are established by manually including issue identifiers in commit logs, leaving a large portion of them lost in the evolution history. To recover issue-commit links, heuristic-based and learning-based techniques leverage the metadata and text/code similarity in issues and commits; however, they fail to capture the embedded semantics in issues and commits and the hidden semantic correlations between issues and commits. As a result, this semantic gap inhibits the accuracy of link recovery.

To bridge this gap, we propose a semantically-enhanced link recovery approach, named DeepLink, which is built on top of deep learning techniques. Specifically, we develop a neural network architecture, using word embedding and recurrent neural network, to learn the semantic representation of natural language descriptions and code in issues and commits as well as the semantic correlation between issues and commits. In experiments, to quantify the prevalence of missing issue-commit links, we analyzed 1078 highly-starred GitHub Java projects (i.e., 583,795 closed issues) and found that only 42.2% of issues were linked to corresponding commits.

This paper presents an instantaneous learning-based control approach for the precise trajectory tracking of a 3D-printed aerial robot which can adapt itself to the changing working conditions. Considering the fact that model-based controllers suffer from lack of modeling, parameter variations and disturbances in their working environment, we observe that the presented learning-based control method has a compelling ability to significantly reduce the tracking error under aforementioned uncertainties throughout the operation. Three case scenarios are considered: payload mass variations on an aerial robot for a package delivery problem, ground effect when the aerial robot is hovering/flying close to the ground, and wind-gust disturbances encountered in the outdoor environment. In each case study, parameter variations are learned using nonlinear moving horizon estimation (NMHE) method, and the estimated parameters are fed to the nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC).

The MPC framework is applied to detect the local running environment real-timely with the concept of receding horizon.

To construct its own optimization problem, a robot first needs to communicate with its neighbors to retrieve their current states. Then, the robot predicts the neighbors' future positions in the current horizon and constructs the problem without waiting for the prediction information from its neighbors.

Demonstrated functionally graded compositions can be created in a direct deposition additive manufacturing system

â¢

Demonstrated the methodology in the functionally graded material going from 316 stainless steel to pure chromium.
Functional grading has recently seen renewed interest with the advancement of additive manufacturing. Unfortunately, the integrity of functional gradients in alloys tends to be compromised by the presence of brittle phases. Recently, CALPHAD-based tools have been used to generate isothermal phase diagrams that are in turn utilized to plan gradient paths that avoid these phases. However, existing frameworks rely extensively on the (limited) ability of humans to visualize and navigate high-dimensional spaces. To tackle this challenge, a Machine Learning approach was used here to map out undesirable regions as âobstaclesâ, while a path-planning algorithm, commonly used in robotics community, was utilized to identify a path in a composition space that would avoid the obstacles, while simultaneously minimizing a cost function. This framework was validated by designing and 3-D printing a functional gradient in bulk samples from 316L stainless steel to pure chromium with a multi-material direct laser deposition system. Both the planned gradient and simple linear gradient samples were fabricated and characterized in as-deposited and heat-treated states to determine local compositions, microstructure and phase constituents. The planned gradient resulted in complete elimination of the detrimental Ï phase after heat treatment, demonstrating the success of the methodology.

The purpose of this paper is to present design and performance evaluation through simulation of a parking management system (PMS) for a fully automated, multi-story, puzzle-type and robotic parking structure with the overall objective of minimizing customer wait times while maximizing the space utilization.

Design/methodology/approach

The presentation entails development and integration of a complete suite of path planning, elevator scheduling and resource allocation algorithms. The PMS aims to manage multiple concurrent requests, in real time and in a dynamic context, for storage and retrieval of vehicles loaded onto robotic carts for a fully automated, multi-story and driving-free parking structure. The algorithm suite employs the incremental informed search algorithm D* Lite with domain-specific heuristics and the uninformed search algorithm Uniform Cost Search for path search and planning. An optimization methodology based on nested partitions and Genetic algorithm is adapted for scheduling of a group of elevators. The study considered a typical business day scenario in the center of a metropolis.

Findings

The simulation study indicates that the proposed design for the PMS is able to serve concurrent storage-retrieval requests representing a wide range of Poisson distributed customer arrival rates in real time while requiring reasonable computing resources under realistic scenarios. The customer waiting times for both storage and retrieval requests are within acceptable bounds, which are set as no more than 5âmin, even in the presence of up to 100 concurrent storage and retrieval requests. The design is able to accommodate a variety of customer arrival rates and presence of immobilized vehicles which are assumed to be scattered across the floors of the structure to make it possible for deployment in real-time environments.

Through the combination of sampling-based planning, a Rapidly Exploring Randomized Tree (RRT) and an efficient kinodynamic motion planner through machine learning, we propose an efficient solution to long-range planning for kinodynamic motion planning. First, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn an obstacle-avoiding policy that maps a robot's sensor observations to actions, which is used as a local planner during planning and as a controller during execution. Second, we train a reachability estimator in a supervised manner, which predicts the RL policy's time to reach a state in the presence of obstacles. Lastly, we introduce RL-RRT that uses the RL policy as a local planner, and the reachability estimator as the distance function to bias tree-growth towards promising regions. We evaluate our method on three kinodynamic systems, including physical robot experiments. Results across all three robots tested indicate that RL-RRT outperforms state of the art kinodynamic planners in efficiency, and also provides a shorter path finish time than a steering function free method.

Extensive simulation showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
Multi-robot systems (MRS) are a reference solution for many prominent real-world applications, e.g. management of warehouses or exploration of unknown environments. One of the most fundamental computational problems in MRS is that of planning the assignment of tasks to robots when such tasks have deadlines, i.e. constraints on when the execution must take place.

The problem, when multiple objective functions of interest need to be optimized, is both NP-Hard and hard to approximate, and few heuristics are known in the literature to handle it. Unfortunately, none of them guarantees that the trajectories used by the robots when moving between tasksâ locations are collision-free at planning time. Rather, they implement a reactive behavior, i.e. they abort the execution of a planned task whenever something goes wrong, e.g. trajectories of robots intersect or a deadline is missed due to some obstacle. This approach induces negative effects on the global performance of the system in the form of waste of energy, due to high distances traveled by the fleet members, or in the form of high convergence time to execute tasks. Therefore, planning the assignments of temporally constrained tasks with the guarantee of avoiding collisions can be a desirable feature for multi-robot systems.

The main contribution of our paper is a focused discussion on what a knowledge representation is as it pertains to the robotics field: a comprehensive tool that encompasses high-level knowledge and low-level features.

This paper aims to define and discuss knowledge representation for robots, to review the literature for existing solutions, and to identify possible issues in the creation of an effective representation. We also review several tools and/or models that have been successfully applied to smaller sub-problems in robot learning and manipulation, which can be used as components to knowledge representations.

We discuss key characteristics of representations that allow them to function, in spite of the highly variable nature of a robotâs working environment and the objects found within it. We also propose specific requirements that are necessary to build the ideal knowledge representation, drawing on concepts discussed in previous works.

The task of robot learning and problem-solving is very broad, as it integrates a variety of tasks such as object detection, activity recognition, task/motion planning, localization, knowledge representation and retrieval, and the intertwining of perception/vision and machine learning techniques. In this paper, we solely focus on knowledge representations and notably how knowledge is typically gathered, represented, and reproduced to solve problems as done by researchers in the past decades. In accordance with the definition of knowledge representations, we discuss the key distinction between such representations and useful learning models that have extensively been introduced and studied in recent years, such as machine learning, deep learning, probabilistic modeling, and semantic graphical structures.

Learning from demonstration provides an effective method to resolve the problem of teaching robot to execute complex motions without expert knowledge about the robot system. In this paper, we present a novel learning from demonstration method based on multi-stage cost learning. The recorded demonstrations are assumed to be composed of several substages chained together. Leveraging this assumption, a segmentation and cost learning framework is proposed to search for the cutting points that divide the unsegmented demonstrations into multiple substages and retrieve cost function for each substage. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first solution to learn multi-stage cost functions in continuous domain without restricting the possible cost functions into limited numbers or simple forms. To generate new trajectory, a complete objective functional is constructed based on the learned multi-stage cost functions plus other constraints like obstacle avoidance and is optimized with functional gradient method.

Such planning approaches are maladapted to realworld deployments, where noise and uncertainty often require paths be recomputed online, which is impossible when planning times are in seconds to minutes. We present PRIMAL, a novel framework for MAPF that combines reinforcement and imitation learning to teach fully decentralized policies, where agents reactively plan paths online in a partially observable world while exhibiting implicit coordination.

Computational thinking (CT) is widely considered to be an important component of teaching generalizable computer science skills to all students in a range of learning environments, including robotics. However, despite advances in the design of robotics curricula that can teach CT, actual enactment in classrooms may often fail to reach this target. This study aims to understand whether the various instructional goals teachersâ hold when using these curricula may offer one potential explanation for disparities in outcomes.

Design/methodology/approach

In this study, the authors examine results from N = 206 middle-school studentsâ pre- and post-tests of CT, attitudinal surveys and surveys of their teacherâs instructional goals to determine if student attitudes and learning gains in CT are related to the instructional goals their teachers endorsed while implementing a shared robotics programming curriculum.

Findings

The findings provide evidence that despite using the same curriculum, students showed differential learning gains on the CT assessment when in classrooms with teachers who rated CT as a more important instructional goal; these effects were particularly strong for women. Students in classroom with teachers who rated CT more highly also showed greater maintenance of positive attitudes toward programming.

370,10.1108/EL-10-2018-0213,,A Chinese ancient book digital humanities research platform to support digital humanities research,ar,Chen C.M.,National Chengchi University,Electronic Library,Journal,"Purpose

With the rapid development of digital humanities, some digital humanities platforms have been successfully developed to support digital humanities research for humanists. However, most of them have still not provided a friendly digital reading environment and practicable social network analysis tool to support humanists on interpreting texts and exploring charactersâ social network relationships. Moreover, the advancement of digitization technologies for the retrieval and use of Chinese ancient books is arising an unprecedented challenge and opportunity. For these reasons, this paper aims to present a Chinese ancient books digital humanities research platform (CABDHRP) to support historical China studies. In addition to providing digital archives, digital reading, basic search and advanced search functions for Chinese ancient books, this platform still provides two novel functions that can more effectively support digital humanities research, including an automatic text annotation system (ATAS) for interpreting texts and a character social network relationship map tool (CSNRMT) for exploring charactersâ social network relationships.

Design/methodology/approach

This study adopted DSpace, an open-source institutional repository system, to serve as a digital archives system for archiving scanned images, metadata, and full texts to develop the CABDHRP for supporting digital humanities (DH) research. Moreover, the ATAS developed in the CABDHRP used the Node.js framework to implement the systemâs front- and back-end services, as well as application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by different databases, such as China Biographical Database (CBDB) and TGAZ, used to retrieve the useful linked data (LD) sources for interpreting ancient texts. Also, Neo4j which is an open-source graph database management system was used to implement the CSNRMT of the CABDHRP. Finally, JavaScript and jQuery were applied to develop a monitoring program embedded in the CABDHRP to record the use processes from humanists based on xAPI (experience API). To understand the research participantsâ perception when interpreting the historical texts and charactersâ social network relationships with the support of ATAS and CSNRMT, semi-structured interviews with 21 research participants were conducted.

Findings

An ATAS embedded in the reading interface of CABDHRP can collect resources from different databases through LD for automatically annotating ancient texts to support digital humanities research. It allows the humanists to refer to resources from diverse databases when interpreting ancient texts, as well as provides a friendly text annotation reader for humanists to interpret ancient text through reading. Additionally, the CSNRMT provided by the CABDHRP can semi-automatically identify charactersâ names based on Chinese word segmentation technology and humanistsâ support to confirm and analyze charactersâ social network relationships from Chinese ancient books based on visualizing charactersâ social networks as a knowledge graph. The CABDHRP not only can stimulate humanists to explore new viewpoints in a humanistic research, but also can promote the public to emerge the learning interest and awareness of Chinese ancient books.

As autonomous service robots become more affordable and thus available for the general public, there is a growing need for user-friendly interfaces to control these systems. Control interfaces typically get more complicated with increasing complexity of robotic tasks and environments. Traditional control modalities such as touch, speech or gesture are not necessarily suited for all users. While some users can make the effort to familiarize themselves with a robotic system, users with motor disabilities may not be capable of controlling such systems even though they need robotic assistance most. In this paper, we present a novel framework that allows these users to interact with a robotic service assistant in a closed-loop fashion, using only thoughts. The system is composed of several interacting components: a brainâcomputer interface (BCI) that uses non-invasive neuronal signal recording and co-adaptive deep learning, high-level task planning based on referring expressions, navigation and manipulation planning as well as environmental perception. We extensively evaluate the BCI in various tasks, determine the performance of the goal formulation user interface and investigate its intuitiveness in a user study. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the system in real-world scenarios, considering fetch-and-carry tasks, close humanârobot interactions and in presence of unexpected changes. As our results show, the system is capable of adapting to frequent changes in the environment and reliably accomplishes given tasks within a reasonable amount of time.

The proposed incremental RL (IRL) algorithm learns from the dynamic environments without making any assumptions or having any prior knowledge about the ever-changing environment. First, IRL generates a detector-agent to detect the changed part of the environment (drift environment) by executing a virtual RL process. Then, the agent gives priority to the drift environment and its neighbor environment for iteratively updating their state-action value functions using new rewards by dynamic programming. After the prioritized sweeping process, IRL restarts a canonical learning process to obtain a new optimal policy adapting to the new environment.

Extracting PHT is of paramount importance in several engineering and clinical applications such as assistive and robotic rehabilitation technologies. In such systems, PHT is modeled as the input noise to the system and thus there is a surge of interest in estimation an compensation of the noise. Although various works in the literature have attempted to estimate and extract the PHT, in this letter, first, we argue that the ground truth signal used in existing works to optimize the performance of tremor extraction techniques is not accurate enough, and thus the performance measures for the prior techniques are not perfectly reliable. In addition, most of the existing tremor extraction techniques impose unrealistic assumptions, which are, typically, violated in practical settings.

Moreover, they are not suited for online information gathering tasks as they assume prior knowledge about GP parameters. This paper presents a novel approach that tackles the two aforementioned issues. Specifically, our approach includes two intertwined steps: (i) a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) search that allows a robot to identify unvisited locations, and to learn the GP parameters, and (ii) an RRT*-based informative path planning that guides the robot towards those locations by maximizing the information gathered while minimizing path cost.

Visual attention is a skill performed by the brain whose functionality is to perceive salient visual features. The automatic design of visual attention programs through an optimization paradigm is applied to the detection-based tracking of objects in a video from a moving camera. A system based on the acquisition and integration steps of the natural dorsal stream was engineered to emulate its selectivity and goal-driven behavior useful to the task of tracking objects.

Cooperation and autonomy are achieved by sensing, information sharing and pheromone detection.

Sensing and communication are limited, as occur for real peripheral devices of robots.
This paper aims to present a cooperative and distributed navigation strategy, that is an on-line path planner, for an autonomous multi-robot system. The robots are intended to navigate and explore an unknown environment in order to find and reach obligatory passage points or way-points (goals), and then achieve a known final position. All robots in the team are homogeneous, independent and have limited communication skills. However they interact among them and with the environment to autonomously decide about their paths and tasks: if they should explore the environment, or avoid visiting a previously explored region, or to reach a discovered goal. Information sharing is directly carried out when the robots are into a communication area and/or indirectly by stigmergy. In this case, artificial pheromone, as a repulsive field, is used to mark regions that have already been explored by other members of the team, therefore avoiding redundant exploration and time waste. Fuzzy controllers are used for robotsâ motion. The proposed on line path planner performance is evaluated in different simulated environment scenarios and the main results are presented.",NO,0,highlights cooperative distributed autonomous navigation system multirobot developed path planning motion control implemented independent distributed way cooperation autonomy achieved sensing information sharing pheromone detection previous knowledge unnecessary navigation end robots positions known sensing communication limited occur real peripheral devices robots paper aims present cooperative distributed navigation strategy online path planner autonomous multirobot system robots intended navigate explore unknown environment order find reach obligatory passage points waypoints goals achieve known final position robots team homogeneous independent limited communication skills however interact among environment autonomously decide paths tasks explore environment avoid visiting previously explored region reach discovered goal information sharing directly carried robots communication area ndor indirectly stigmergy case artificial pheromone repulsive field used mark regions already explored members team therefore avoiding redundant exploration time waste fuzzy controllers used robots motion proposed line path planner performance evaluated different simulated environment scenarios main results presented,bioinspired online path planner cooperative exploration unknown environment multirobot system

Sharing symbols requires that each agent has anchored a symbol with an internal, sensor level representation, as well as that these symbols match between the agents. The problem can be solved easily when the internal representations can be communicated between the agents. However, with heterogeneous embodiments the available sensors are likely to differ, making it impossible to share the internal representations directly. We propose the use of pointing gestures to align symbols between a heterogeneous group of robots. We describe a planning framework that minimizes the required effort for anchoring representations across robots. The framework allows planning for both the gesturing and observing agents in a decentralized fashion. It considers both implicit sources of failure, such as ambiguous pointing, as well as costs required by actions.

402,10.1007/s10514-018-9725-6,,Robot learning of industrial assembly task via human demonstrations,ar,Kyrarini M.,UniversitÃ¤t Bremen,Autonomous Robots,Journal,"Humanârobot collaboration in industrial applications is a challenging robotic task. Human working together with the robot at a workplace to complete a task may create unpredicted events for the robot, as humans can act unpredictably. Humans tend to perform a task in a not fully repetitive manner using their expertise and cognitive capabilities. The traditional robot programming cannot cope with these challenges of humanârobot collaboration. In this paper, a framework for robot learning by multiple human demonstrations is introduced. Through the demonstrations, the robot learns the sequence of actions for an assembly task (high-level learning) without the need of pre-programming. Additionally, the robot learns every path as needed for object manipulation (low-level learning). Once the robot has the knowledge of the demonstrated task, it can perform the task in collaboration with the human. However, the need for adaptation of the learned knowledge may arise as the human collaborator could introduce changes in the environment, such as placing an object to be manipulated in a position and orientation different from the demonstrated ones. In this paper, a novel real-time adaptation algorithm to cope with these changes in the environment, introduced by the human factor, is proposed. The proposed algorithm is able to identify the sequence of actions needed to be performed in a new environment. A Gaussian Mixture Model-based modification algorithm is able to adapt the learned path in order to enable robot to successfully complete the task without the need of additional training by demonstration. The proposed framework copes with changes in the position and orientation of the objects to be manipulated and also provides obstacle avoidance.

These characteristics will seriously affect the accurate extraction of weld seam. To realize the automatic path planning of welding robots, a new method of automatic extraction and identification of narrow butt joint under weak contrast is realized to serve the 3D path teaching of welding robots. To achieve accurate extraction of narrow butt joint under weak contrast, this paper designs a new seam extraction operator to achieve accurate and fast extraction of weld seam with various shapes and sizes.

Besides, understanding the semantics of a task is necessary to work efficiently and react to changes in the task execution process. As a result, in order to achieve seamless collaboration, appropriate reasoning, learning skills and interaction capabilities are needed.

To further improve the efficiency, a reward function at subtask-level is proposed to provide global guidance for the agent in the DRL. The subtask-level reward function is designed under the assumption that the task can be divided into several subtasks, which reduces the invalid exploration greatly. The extensive experiments show that the proposed reward functions are able to improve the convergence rate by up to three times with the state-of-the-art DRL methods.

A characteristic of these systems is a scalable programming model based on distributed collections and parallel transformations expressed by means of second-order functions such as map and reduce. Notable examples are Flinkâs DataSet and Sparkâs RDD programming abstractions. These programming models are realized as EDSLsâdomain specific languages embedded in a general-purpose host language such as Java, Scala, or Python. This approach has several advantages over traditional external DSLs such as SQL or XQuery. First, syntactic constructs from the host language (e.g., anonymous functions syntax, value definitions, and fluent syntax via method chaining) can be reused in the EDSL. This eases the learning curve for developers already familiar with the host language. Second, it allows for seamless integration of library methods written in the host language via the function parameters passed to the parallel dataflow operators. This reduces the effort for developing analytics dataflows that go beyond pure SQL and require domain-specific logic.

At the same time, however, state-of-the-art parallel dataflow EDSLs exhibit a number of shortcomings. First, one of the main advantages of an external DSL such as SQLâthe high-level, declarative Select-From-Where syntaxâis either lost completely or mimicked in a non-standard way. Second, execution aspects such as caching, join order, and partial aggregation have to be decided by the programmer. Optimizing them automatically is very difficult due to the limited program context available in the intermediate representation of the DSL.

In this article, we argue that the limitations listed above are a side effect of the adopted type-based embedding approach. As a solution, we propose an alternative EDSL design based on quotations. We present a DSL embedded in Scala and discuss its compiler pipeline, intermediate representation, and some of the enabled optimizations. We promote the algebraic type of bags in union representation as a model for distributed collections and its associated structural recursion scheme and monad as a model for parallel collection processing. At the source code level, Scalaâs comprehension syntax over a bag monad can be used to encode Select-From-Where expressions in a standard way. At the intermediate representation level, maintaining comprehensions as a first-class citizen can be used to simplify the design and implementation of holistic dataflow optimizations that accommodate for nesting and control-flow.

Multi-shot ASP solving features grounding and solving processes that deal with continuously changing logic programs. In doing so, they remain operative and accommodate changes in a seamless way. For instance, such processes allow for advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or interaction with an environment, as in robotics or query answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. This evolutionary aspect adds another dimension to ASP since it brings about state changing operations. We address this issue by providing an operational semantics that characterizes grounding and solving processes in multi-shot ASP solving. This characterization provides a semantic account of grounder and solver states along with the operations manipulating them. The operative nature of multi-shot solving avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language with control capacities. On the declarative side, a new directive allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side. To this end, clingo offers a new application programming interface that is conveniently accessible via scripting languages.

Results: Safety system components such as discipline programs, inspection programs, modified duty programs, off-the-job safety training programs, and recognition programs are positively related to individual safety climate for both managerial employees and nonmanagerial employees. Variables representing an employeeâs agricultural background, distance between their workplace and childhood home, and formal education are not associated with managerial safety climate. However, agricultural background and childhood home distance are associated with nonmanagerial safety climate.

Results on benchmarks from literature demonstrate EQL efficiency and superiority.
In fact, optimizing path within short computation time still remains a major challenge for mobile robotics applications. In path planning and obstacles avoidance, Q-Learning (QL) algorithm has been widely used as a computational method of learning through environment interaction. However, less emphasis is placed on path optimization using QL because of its slow and weak convergence toward optimal solutions. Therefore, this paper proposes an Efficient Q-Learning (EQL) algorithm to overcome these limitations and ensure an optimal collision-free path in less possible time. In the QL algorithm, successful learning is closely dependent on the design of an effective reward function and an efficient selection strategy for an optimal action that ensures exploration and exploitation. In this regard, a new reward function is proposed to initialize the Q-table and provide the robot with prior knowledge of the environment, followed by a new efficient selection strategy proposal to accelerate the learning process through search space reduction while ensuring a rapid convergence toward an optimized solution. The main idea is to intensify research at each learning stage, around the straight-line segment linking the current position of the robot to Target (optimal path in terms of length). During the learning process, the proposed strategy favors promising actions that not only lead to an optimized path but also accelerate the convergence of the learning process. The proposed EQL algorithm is first validated using benchmarks from the literature, followed by a comparison with other existing QL-based algorithms. The achieved results showed that the proposed EQL gained good learning proficiency; besides, the training performance is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art.

Compiler optimizations such as the loop access order and data layout transformations paired with architectural optimizations such as prefetching and preshifting are employed to reduce the shifting overhead in RTMs. Optimizations for off-chip memory such as memory access order, data mapping and the choice of a suitable memory access granularity are employed to reduce the contention in the off-chip memory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed optimizations improve the SPM performance and energy consumption by 32% and 73%, respectively, compared to an iso-capacity SRAM.

An alternative approach is teaching by demonstration, by instrumenting hand-held tools for capturing both the force and the contact point while an expert operator performs tooling tasks. This paper presents a novel approach for instrumenting hand-held tools for polishing/grinding used in monitoring the performance of skilled human operators which can be, in future work, translated into planning strategies for robot programming and control. More specifically, the instrumented tool is designed to monitor interaction forces with the workpiece and point of contact, where these interaction forces arise.

Kinematic redundancy also exists in these robotic systems. The jerk of motion is optimized in our trajectory planning method at the meanwhile of fabrication process to improve the quality of fabrication. Our method is based on a sampling strategy and consists of two major parts. After determining an initial path by graph search, a greedy algorithm is adopted to optimize a path by locally applying adaptive filers in the regions with large jerks. The filtered result is obtained by numerical optimization. In order to achieve efficient computation, an adaptive sampling method is developed for learning a collision-indication function that is represented as a support-vector machine. Applications in robot-assisted 3-D printing are given in this article to demonstrate the functionality of our approach. Note to Practitioners-In robot-assisted manufacturing applications, robotic arms are employed to realize the motion of workpieces (or machining tools) specified as a sequence of waypoints with the positions of tool tip and the tool orientations constrained. The required degree of freedom (DOF) is often less than the robotic hardware system (e.g., a robotic arm has six-DOF). Specifically, rotations of the workpiece around the axis of a tool can be arbitrary (see Fig. 1 for an example). By using this redundancy, i.e., there are many possible poses of a robotic arm to realize a given waypoint, the trajectory of robots can be optimized to consider the performance of motion in velocity, acceleration, and jerk in the joint space. In addition, when fabricating complex models, each tool path can have a large amount of waypoints.

However, such re-planning strategies often cause unnecessary detours. To address this issue, we propose a learning-based technique that exploits environmental spatio-temporal information.

The navigation of autonomous, mobile multi-robot systems in changing environments is a challenging problem investigated over the past years. Cooperative, multiple robots are employed for many different tasks to increase the efficiency and success of a mission. However, many of the existing collective path planning approaches do not guarantee a reliable escape in environments with complex, non-convex obstacles without any prior knowledge.

Among others, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are increasingly used in real-time applications to solve such complex optimization problems. Moreover, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been proved an effective platform for the implementation of these algorithms satisfying real-time and low-power requirements. In this paper, we study the FPGA-based acceleration of the Big Bang-Big Crunch (BB-BC) algorithm. BB-BC is an optimization method inspired by the corresponding evolutionary theory of the universe [1]. The BB-BC method is performed in two phases: in the Bing Bang phase, similarly to other Genetic Algorithms (GAs) it generates a random population of candidate solutions, while in the Big Crunch phase it shrinks these candidates around an optimal point. It has been shown that the BB-BC method outperforms classical GA algorithms for several optimization problems in terms of convergence speed. We show that the BB-BC algorithm does not suffer from the design limitations of the classical GAs that impede the performance of their hardware-based accelerators. We propose an efficient fully pipelined design of both BB-BC phases and a parallel scheme which integrates several BB-BC pipelined engines to improve system performance. We implement the proposed FPGA-based accelerator on a Xilinx Virtex-5 development board for three different fitness functions and compare the execution time against its software counterpart (in C language) and a CUDA program running on a massively parallel computing platform (GPU).

The project is equipped with a robotic arm that serves to select, capture, and locate nylon elements of different colors and shapes, placing them in different classification trays; it will also be visualized on a graphic interface through a monitor. Elements such as the Arduino data processing card, a 1920Ã1080 pixel HD camera to improve the visualization of the shapes and color of the element and a conveyor belt that will allow the movement of the elements have been used. Using the images obtained by the camera and processed in binary form in the Arduino, an automated control of the robotic arm that allows controlled movement and proper positioning in the corresponding sorting tray is obtained. The processing of the images uses a specific programming to make the edge detection and to obtain the points of the image that belongs to the border of the desired figure. Due to the imperfections of the image a process of filters in the image is followed as the scaling, the dilation of the image that allows suppressing the background of the figure and finally the erosion that helps to join or to obtain an outline to the desired shape. With the design and the construction of this didactic module of artificial vision, students and teaching staff will be provided with a better visualization of an industrial environment in automated inspection and quality control tasks, with the aim of improving the repetitiveness and precision obtained in a manual inspection process.

In this article, we present âAirScope,â a mobile sensing system that employs cooperative robots to monitor the indoor air quality. Since the wireless coverage can be incomplete in some indoor areas, AirScope allows the robots to defer uploading the data to the central server by utilizing their own data buffers. In order to guarantee the timeliness of the data in the server, AirScope aims to minimize the average data latency by properly planning the routes of the robots. Such a route planning strategy has to be implemented in a distributed way since the robots that are out of wireless coverage can only make plans on their own. In addition, the cooperation of the robots is also necessary because the aggregation of the robots in a small area increases the average data latency of the other unattended areas. To solve this distributed and cooperative routing planning problem, we propose a solution based on distributed deep Q-learning (DDQL).

To perform specific tasks in dynamic environments, robots are required to rapidly update trajectories according to changing factors. A continuous trajectory planning methodology for serial manipulators based on non-convex global optimization is presented in this paper. First, a kinematic trajectory planning model based on non-convex optimization is constructed to balance motion rapidity and safety. Then, a model transformation method for the non-convex optimization model is presented. In this way, the accurate global solution can be obtained with an iterative solver starting from arbitrary initializations, which can greatly improve the computational accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, an efficient initialization method for the iterative solver based on multivariable-multiple regression is presented, which further speeds up the solution process. The results show that trajectory planning efficiency is significantly enhanced by model transformation and initialization improvement for the iterative solver.

Smartphoneâs popularity and their constant connectivity to the World Wide Web have made these devices vulnerable to phishing and smishing attacks. Phishing is a practice of sending malicious emails to users. Smishing is a combined form of SMS and Phishing in which invaders send SMS containing malicious content to the victim. This content sometimes includes links which redirect the user to websites containing malicious applications and user interfaces. Researchers have proposed various methods in past years to detect smishing but still, we lack a method that significantly avoids false-positive results i.e. falsely categorizing a message as malicious when it is genuine. Hence, we have proposed a model called âSmishing Detectorâ to identify smishing messages while reducing false-positive results at every possible step. The proposed method consists of four modules, namely, SMS Content Analyzer, URL Filter, Source Code Analyzer and Apk Download Detector. SMS Content Analyzer analyzes the text message contents. Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm is used to identify the malicious contents and keywords present in the text message. URL Filter inspects the URL to identify malicious features. Source Code Analyzer examines the source code of the website to identify the harmful code embedded in it. Form tag and URL domain present in the source code are also inspected in this module. APK Download Detector identifies whether any malicious file is downloaded while invoking the URL. User consent taken while downloading the file is also inspected in this module. Finally, we have developed a prototype of the proposed system which has been validated with experiments on SMS datasets. In this paper, we have demonstrated the results of each module separately and also we have demonstrated the final results. The results of the experiments show an overall accuracy of 96.29%.

The approach is capable of learning and focusing on regions of interest via adaptation to map either discrete or continuous variables on the terrain using variable-resolution data received from probabilistic sensors. During a mission, the terrain maps built online are used to plan information-rich trajectories in continuous 3-D space by optimizing initial solutions obtained by a coarse grid search.

From the earliest days of AI, it was apparent that a robust, generally intelligent system should include a complete set of capabilities: perception, memory, reasoning, learning, planning, and action; and when DARPA initiated AI research in the 1960s, ambitious projects such as Shakey the Robot went after the complete package. As DARPA realized the challenges, they backed away from the ultimate goal of integrated AI and tried to make progress on the individual problems of image understanding, speech and language understanding, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning and decision aids, machine learning, and robotic manipulation. Yet, even as researchers struggled to make progress in these subdisciplines, DARPA periodically resurrected the challenge of integrated intelligent systems and pushed the community to try again. In the 1980s, DARPAâs Strategic Computing Initiative took on challenges of integrated AI projects such as the Autonomous Land Vehicle and the Pilotâs Associate. These did not succeed, but instead set the stage for the several decades of more siloed research that followed, until it was time to try again.

Humanoid robots are a great challenge in robotics. The concept of digital twin technology complies with the guiding ideology of not only Industry 4.0, but also Made in China 2025. This paper proposes a scheme that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with digital twin technology for controlling humanoid robot arms. For rapid and stable motion planning for humanoid robots, multitasking-oriented training using the twin synchro-control (TSC) scheme with DRL is proposed. For switching between tasks, the robot arm training must be quick and diverse. In this work, an approach for obtaining a priori knowledge as input to DRL is developed and verified using simulations. Two simple examples are developed in a simulation environment. We developed a data acquisition system to generate angle data efficiently and automatically. These data are used to improve the reward function of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and quickly train the robot for a task. The approach is applied to a model of the humanoid robot BHR-6, a humanoid robot with multiple-motion mode and a sophisticated mechanical structure. Using the policies trained in the simulations, the humanoid robot can perform tasks that are not possible to train with existing methods. The training is fast and allows the robot to perform multiple tasks. Our approach utilizes human joint angle data collected by the data acquisition system to solve the problem of a sparse reward in DRL for two simple tasks.

A scalable way to combat this problem is to leverage people's spatial understanding of scenes by crowdsourcing visual annotations of 3D object properties. Unfortunately, getting people to directly estimate 3D properties reliably is difficult due to the limitations of image resolution, human motor accuracy, and people's 3D perception (i.e., humans do not ""see"" depth like a laser range finder).

Drawing on the idea of learning from demonstration (LfD), the method inputs the demonstration data both into the generator and the discriminator in order to improve the stability of training process by leveraging from the demonstration data rather than simply from the exploration data.
This paper proposes a deterministic generative adversarial imitation learning method which allows the robot to implement the motion planning task rapidly by learning from the demonstration data without reward function. In our method, the deep deterministic policy gradient method is used as the generator for learning the action policy on the basis of discriminator, and the demonstration data is input into the generator to ensure its stability. Three experiments on the push and pick-and-place tasks are conducted in the gym robotic environment. Results show that the learning speed of our method is much faster than the stochastic generative adversarial imitation learning method, and it can effectively learn from the demonstration data in different states of the task with higher learning stability. The proposed method can complete the motion planning task without environmental reward quickly and improve the stability of the training process.

In its latest series of âCourses of Studyâ, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan strongly recommends the use of active learning systems and the introduction of computer programming education courses in elementary schools. Programming instruction typically includes explanations of the basic syntax used in programming languages, the application of that syntax, and related exercises. However, the teachers in programming classes commonly spend much more time correcting errors, that is, debugging their studentsâ programs, than they spend teaching. These delays can affect the progress of programming lessons and the motivation of the participating students. With these points in mind, we have developed a teaching assistant robot that is designed to support efficient classroom management of programming classes by advising and assisting students who are encountering problems. Herein, we describe the tasks performed by the teaching assistant robot in a classroom environment in which actual programming lessons are assumed to be taught. In particular, we explain the problems encountered by students in the process of learning basic programming techniques, the causes of the problems, the method by which the teaching assistant robot identifies those problems, and the contents of advice provided by the teaching assistant robot corresponding to those problems. We also show the effectiveness of the teaching assistant robot by conducting evaluation experiments.

Due to the complex surface characteristics of artificial joints, there are some problems with efficiency and precision in automatic cladding path planning for coating fabrication. In this study, a path planning method for a laser cladding robot for artificial joints surface was proposed. The key of this method was the topological reconstruction of the artificial joint surface. On the basis of the topological relation, a set of parallel planes were used to intersect the CAD model to generate a set of continuous, directed and equidistant surface transversals on the artificial joint surface. The arch height error method was used to extract robot interpolation points from surface transversal lines according to machining accuracy requirements. The coordinates and normal vectors of interpolation points were used to calculate the position and pose of the robot tool center point (TCP). To ensure that the laser beam was always perpendicular to the artificial joint surface, a novel laser cladding set-up with a robot was designed, of which the joint part clamped by a six-axis robot moved while the laser head was fixed on the workbench. The proposed methodology was validated with the planned path on the surface of an artificial acetabular cup using simulation and experimentation via an industrial NACHI robot.

However, such controllers may fail when the robot cannot reach contacts capable of rejecting a given disturbance.

Small rapidly deployable robots can substantially improve manufacturing safety and productivity. However, relatively rapid full automation remains elusive due to high-level of uncertainty in the environment, lack of cost-effective programming for low volume production, and difficulty of deploying adequate number of sensors in the confined space. Moreover, currently, teleoperation (remote human control of a robot via a force-reflection device) with typical levels of training and limited transparency of hardware is too slow for manufacturing applications, requiring experts to spend more time for each task to achieve the same cleaning quality. In this context, the main contribution of this article is to reduce cycle times for remote manufacturing by learning statistical dynamic autonomy from higher quality expert demonstrations in an ideal offline scenario. During the task, to keep cycle times low, the dynamic autonomy imitates the faster expert demonstrations when certain, and employs the slower human teleoperation when uncertain.

The model also takes lesser time to generate this path compared to conventional methods.
Tiling robotics have been deployed in autonomous complete area coverage tasks such as floor cleaning, building inspection, and maintenance, surface painting. One class of tiling robotics, polyomino-based reconfigurable robots, overcome the limitation of fixed-form robots in achieving high-efficiency area coverage by adopting different morphologies to suit the needs of the current environment. Since the reconfigurable actions of these robots are produced by real-time intelligent decisions during operations, an optimal path planning algorithm is paramount to maximize the area coverage while minimizing the energy consumed by these robots. This paper proposes a complete coverage path planning (CCPP) model trained using deep blackreinforcement learning (RL) for the tetromino based reconfigurable robot platform called hTetro to simultaneously generate the optimal set of shapes for any pretrained arbitrary environment shape with a trajectory that has the least overall cost. To this end, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers is trained using Actor Critic Experience Replay (ACER) reinforcement learning algorithm. The results are compared with existing approaches which are based on the traditional tiling theory model, including zigzag, spiral, and greedy search schemes. The model is also compared with the Travelling salesman problem (TSP) based Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) schemes.

In this article, we leverage an existing dataset where electrodermal activity (EDA) was used to identify markers of productive collaboration. The data came from 42 pairs of participants (NÂ =â84) who had no coding experience and were asked to program a robot to solve a variety of mazes. Because little is known on how physiological synchrony relates to collaborative learning, we explored four different measures of synchrony: Signal Matching (SM), Instantaneous Derivative Matching (IDM), Directional Agreement (DA) and Pearsonâs Correlation (PC). Overall, we found PC to be positively associated with learning gains (râ=â0.35) and DA with collaboration quality (râ=â0.3). To gain further insights into these results, we also qualitatively analyzed two groups and identified situations with high or low physiological synchrony. We observed higher synchrony values when members of a productive group reacted to an external event (e.g., following instructions, receiving a hint), oscillations when they were watching a video or interacting with each other, and lower values when they were programming and / or seem to be confused. Based on these results, we developed a new measure of collaboration using electrodermal data: we computed the number of cycles between low and high synchronization. We found this measure to be significantly correlated with collaboration quality (râ=â0.57) and learning gains (râ=â0.47). This measure was not significantly correlated with the measures of physiological synchrony mentioned above, suggesting that it is capturing a different construct.

Therefore, the trajectories are typically planned offline and tracked online. However, this approach is not suitable if the target has relative motion with respect to the servicing space robot. To handle this issue, a model-free reinforcement learning strategy is proposed for training a policy for online trajectory planning without establishing the dynamic and kinematic models of the space robot.

The purpose of this paper is to present a method which enables a robot to learn both motion skills and stiffness profiles from humans through kinesthetic human-robot cooperation.

Design Methodology Approach

Admittance control is applied to allow robot-compliant behaviors when following the reference trajectories. By extending the dynamical movement primitives (DMP) model, a new concept of DMP and stiffness primitives is introduced to encode a kinesthetic demonstration as a combination of trajectories and stiffness profiles, which are subsequently transferred to the robot. Electromyographic signals are extracted from a humanâs upper limbs to obtain target stiffness profiles. By monitoring vibrations of the end-effector velocities, a stability observer is developed. The virtual damping coefficient of admittance controller is adjusted accordingly to eliminate the vibrations.

Findings

The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated experimentally. The result shows that the robot can perform tasks in a variable stiffness mode as like the human dose in the teaching phase.

A general color imageâbased vision-guided robot picking system requires feature extraction and goal image preparation of various objects.

Our method uses a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model that is trained on 15,000 annotated depth images synthetically generated in a physics simulator to directly predict grasp points without object segmentation. Unlike previous studies that predicted grasp points for a robot suction hand with only one vacuum cup, our DCNN also predicts optimal grasp patterns for a hand with two vacuum cups (left cup on, right cup on, or both cups on). Further, we propose a surface feature descriptor to extract surface features (center position and normal) and refine the predicted grasp point position, removing the need for texture features for vision-guided robot control and sim-to-real modification for DCNN model training.

The key technical idea behind our approach is to leverage tools from generalization theory in machine learning by exploiting a precise analogy (which we present in the form of a reduction) between generalization of control policies to novel environments and generalization of hypotheses in the supervised learning setting. In particular, we utilize the probably approximately correct (PAC)-Bayes framework, which allows us to obtain upper bounds that hold with high probability on the expected cost of (stochastic) control policies across novel environments. We propose policy learning algorithms that explicitly seek to minimize this upper bound. The corresponding optimization problem can be solved using convex optimization (relative entropy programming in particular) in the setting where we are optimizing over a finite policy space. In the more general setting of continuously parameterized policies (e.g., neural network policies), we minimize this upper bound using stochastic gradient descent.

This paper presented the framework for the integration of digital technologies in education, implemented in InTecEdu Program, developed by Remote Experimentation Laboratory (RExLab), Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil.

Background
The main objective of the model presented is to arouse interest in science and technology among adolescents. Therefore, it sought to develop STEM competencies (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) in children and adolescents. Understanding learning in STAM areas can favor the development of professionals who can supply the demand in related sectors, especially in the scientific-technological scope. To fulfill the main objective, strategies related to students and teachers were developed. With activities aimed at students, it was hoped to promote vocations to scientific-technological careers and encourage entrepreneurship. On the other hand, the activities related to teachers aimed at training them to integrate technology into their lesson plans. Inspired by the Maker Culture, the model sought to make it possible for teachers to become the main agents in the process of integrating technology in their lesson plans, since they were in charge of building and producing their digital content and other resources to support their didactic activities. The maker movement is a technological extension of the âDo It Yourself!â culture, which encourages ordinary people to build, modify, repair, and manufacture their objects, with their own hands. The training actions were preceded by a diagnosis, inspired by the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, as well as the lesson plans prepared and made available by the teachers.

Methodology
Methodologically, the frameworkâs work plan was composed of five Work Packages (WP), which include management, resource mapping, strategies related to teachers, strategies related to students, and the dissemination and exploitation of results. In the 2014-2018 period, 367 teachers participated in training activities, intending to integrate technologies into lesson plans. At the end of 2018, 27 Basic Education schools, including an indigenous and a rural school, from the public-school system, in the states of Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, and the Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, using the projectâs Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). In these 70 teachers, 230 classes, and 6,766 students accessed didactic content, produced by teachers, at VLE. Also, 20 laboratories were available in 26 instances, for use in practical activities in disciplines in the STEM areas. Specifically, in the STEM areas, 3,360 students from 98 classes from 9 schools had integrated the Remote Laboratories, in lesson plans in the subjects of Physics and Biology (High School), Science (Elementary School).

Contribution
The main results of the application of the framework are related to the training of human resources, knowledge production, and educational innovation. About the training of human resources, we sought to contribute to the training of teachers concerning technology in education and, with that, arouse greater interest on the part of students, as well as obtain improvements in their learning from teaching methodologies supported on the use of digital technologies. On the other hand, the production of knowledge, in the program and the socialization of research, is favored by the model based on open-source resources, both in terms of software and hardware and with open educational resources. This characteristic favor and expands the potential for reapplying research and, consequently, its contribution to educational innovation.

Findings
The results, about students, indicated an increase in motivation due to the creation of new teaching and learning opportunities. The fact of extending the classroom and school, through remote laboratories, to support practical activities and the use of VLE, was also pointed out as a very positive factor. On the other hand, the realization of the workshops, inspired by practices of the Maker Culture, provided an approximation of these to the skills of the real world, which will certainly favor their employability. Regarding the teachers, it is noticed the continuity and expansion in the use of technological resources in the classroom; many sought and have participated in new training actions.

Recommendations for Practitioners
Provision of a repository of practices for sharing and reuse of lesson plans developed by teachers participating in the research. Technical documents, manuals, and guides for robotics, computer programming, electronics and new technology workshops for students.

Recommendation for Researchers
Technical documents, manuals, and guides for remote laboratories. Data collected in the applied questionnaires. Technical documents, manuals, and guides for robotics, computer programming, electronics and new technology workshops for students.

Impact on Society
The main results of the framework application are related to human resources formation, knowledge production, and educational innovation. Regarding the formation of human resources, we sought to contribute to the formation of teachers concerning technology in education and, about the students the creation of teaching and learning opportunities, to extend the classroom and also the school, through the remote laboratories, to support the practical activities and the use of the VLE.

One of the challenging tasks for those robots is planning optimal trajectories due to, not only the redundant Degrees of Freedom (DOF) they own but also their compliant behaviour. In this paper, an Imitation-based Pose Planning (IbPP) approach is proposed to teach a two-section continuum robot the motion primitives that will facilitate achieving and generalizing for spatial point-to-point motion which involves both position and orientation goals encoded in a dual quaternion form. Two novel approaches are proposed in this research to intuitively generate the motion demonstrations that will be used in the proposed IbPP. Namely, a flexible input interface, acting as a twin robot, is designed to allow a human to demonstrate different motions for the robot end-effector. Alternatively, as a second approach, the Microsoft Kinect sensor is used to provide motion demonstrations faster via human arm movements. Based on the kinematic model of the two-section continuum robot, a Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) algorithm is developed to achieve tracking the generated trajectory from the IbPP and to guarantee the robustness against the model uncertainties and external disturbances. Moreover, controller stability analysis is developed based on Lyapunov criteria. Finally, simulations are conducted for the two-section continuum robot to prove the ability of the proposed IbPP with the two proposed inputs to learn and generalize for spatial motions, which in future could be easily accommodated for robots with multiple sections.

With the continuous development of applications, the missions faced by USV are becoming more and more complex, so it is difficult for a single USV to meet the mission requirements. Compared with a single USV, a multi-USV system has some outstanding advantages such as fewer perceptual constraints, larger operation ranges, and stronger operation capability. In the search mission about multiple stationary underwater targets by a multi-USV system in the environment with obstacles, we propose a novel cooperative search algorithm (CSBDRL) based on reinforcement learning (RL) method and probability map method. CSBDRL is composed of the environmental sense module and policy module, which are organized by the âdivide and conquerâ policy-based architecture. The environmental sense module focuses on providing environmental sense values by using the probability map method. The policy module focuses on learning the optimal policy by using RL method.

In the proposed system, we use an LW-RCP(Light Weight-Rapid Control Prototyping) system, which is lab-built, to help students implement the control algorithm. An RCP system makes it easy for students who are not familiar with u-Controller or the C language to implement controllers. We also use Odroid, a low-cost SBC (single-board computer), and a single camera to calculate the position of ball using a machine vision algorithm. In this structure, the measurement subsystem is more durable compared with contact-based sensing systems and student can test their own machine vision algorithms for better measurements. We adopt the Stewart platform, a type of parallel robot, to generate roll-and-pitch actuation for the ball-and-plate system. By adopting the Stewart platform, we can handle more complicated control problems for movement that requires more than two degrees of freedom. Additionally, we implement an LQ controller, which is a typical model-based controller, and apply it to the ball-plate system.

Nevertheless, demonstrations are sparse and inaccurate in almost all real-world problems. Complementary information is needed to compensate these shortcomings of demonstrations. In this paper, we target programming by a combination of nonoptimal and sparse demonstrations and a limited number of binary evaluative feedbacks, where the learner uses its own evaluated experiences as new demonstrations in an extended inverse reinforcement learning method. This provides the learner with a broader generalization and less regret as well as robustness in face of sparsity and nonoptimality in demonstrations and feedbacks. Our method alleviates the unrealistic burden on teachers to provide optimal and abundant demonstrations. Employing an evaluative feedback, which is easy for teachers to deliver, provides the opportunity to correct the learnerâs behavior in an interactive social setting without requiring teachers to know and use their own accurate reward function. Here, we enhance the inverse reinforcement learning () to estimate the reward function using a mixture of nonoptimal and sparse demonstrations and evaluative feedbacks. Our method, called  from demonstration and humanâs critique (), has two phases. The teacher first provides some demonstrations for the learner to initialize its policy. Next, the learner interacts with the environment and the teacher provides binary evaluative feedbacks. Taking into account possible inconsistencies and mistakes in issuing and receiving feedbacks, the learner revises the estimated reward function by solving a single optimization problem. The  is devised to handle errors and sparsities in demonstrations and feedbacks and can generalize different combinations of these two sources expertise.

Current researches focus on the problem of modeling aperiodic/periodic robot motions and extracting dynamic task parameters from the recorded sensory information. However, it is still not adequate for describing complex behaviors in an unstructured environment, such as searching for an unknown fitting position or painting/polishing an irregular surface. The quasi-periodic and stochastic properties cause a high demand for generalization ability of the modeling techniques. This paper proposes a systematic framework for learning quasi-periodic robot motions, which contains three steps: decomposition, modeling, and synthesization. Firstly FFT transform is performed to identify all the frequencies in the quasi-periodic motion. Then the motion is decomposed into an offset component, a series of harmonic and corresponding envelop components based on the concept of equivalent transformation. The offset component is extracted by Empirical Mode Decomposition, harmonic is separated by notch filter, and envelope component is extracted by Hilbert Transform. These components are either periodic or aperiodic. The aperiodic motions can be modeled by conventional techniques such as Gaussian Mixture Model and recovered by Gaussian Mixture Regression. The periodic motions are modeled in closed-form expressions. Finally, they are synthesized together to regenerate the robot motion. This modeling process captures both the aperiodicity and periodicity of a quasi-periodic motion. Simulation and experiment show that the proposed methods are feasible, effective and can predict robot motions beyond demonstrations.

Human trajectory prediction is an important topic in several application domains, ranging from self-driving cars to environment design and planning, from socially-aware robots to intelligent tracking systems. This complex subject comes with different challenges, such as human-space interaction, human-human interaction, multimodality, and generalizability. Currently, these challenges, especially generalizability, have not been completely explored by state-of-the-art works. This work attempts to fill this gap by proposing and defining new methods and metrics to help understand trajectories. In particular, new deep learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory and Generative Adversarial Network architectures are used in both unimodal and multimodal contexts. These approaches are evaluated with new error metrics, which normalize some biases in standard metrics. Tests have been assessed using newly collected datasets characterized by a higher diversity and lower linearity than those used in state-of-the-art works. The results prove that the proposed models and datasets are comparable to and yield better generalizability than state-of-the-art works.

The tool trajectory generation with minimal end-user programming/re-programming.
Surface finishing, as the final stage in the manufacturing pipeline, is a key process in determining the quality and life span of a product. Such a task is characterized by low contact forces and minimal material removal from the object surface. Despite the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, human workforce is still irreplaceable in performing such tasks due to superior dexterity and adaptability, but this is often prone to risks such as hand-arm vibration syndrome due to hand-held tools. Therefore, we propose a collaborative approach to assist the human in carrying out such tasks with the help of two case studies: HumanâRobot-Collaborative edge chamfering and polishing tasks, based on an impedance controlled collaborative curve tracing technique.

We propose a collaborative framework, where the robot assists an operator to guide the end-effector/tool along a pre-defined parametric curve. The algorithm is demonstrated in two scenarios. In the first case, we address a collaborative chamfering task whereas the second case focuses on a polishing application (for straight edges). For these kinds of tasks, the curve to be traced assumes the shape of a straight line along the edge. We make use of the compliant feature of a cobot, which allows the user to physically guide the robot in the task space, to generate a mathematical model for the tool path. From the end-user perspective, this is more intuitive than the classical programming-based path planning approaches.

The focused optimal search algorithm was applied to minimize the initial path.
Autonomous path planning plays an important role in the navigation of intelligent underwater robots. Path planning is a nondeterministic polynomial hard issue in classical path planning models. This problem can be solved using various sample-based strategies. However, the effectiveness of these sample-based strategies is significantly lower in underwater environments, owing to the special undulating terrain and obstacles that are sparser compared to those in the ground. In this study, a more efficient underwater path planning method is proposed for underwater robot navigation. The method employs a goal-biased Gaussian sampling algorithm to select searching nodes optimally, and a focused optimal search algorithm is proposed to accelerate the path optimization process. Combining these two algorithms results in high-efficiency and fast autonomous underwater path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate a shorter path and is more efficient than a rapidly exploring random tree star in underwater robot navigation.

While planning approaches are good at generating feasible whole-body robot trajectories, they struggle with dynamic environments as well as the incorporation of constraints given by the task and the environment. On the other hand, dynamic motion models in the action space struggle with generating kinematically feasible trajectories for mobile manipulation actions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn feasible dynamic motions for a mobile base while the end-effector follows a trajectory in task space generated by an arbitrary system to fulfill the task at hand. This modular formulation has several benefits: it enables us to readily transform a broad range of end-effector motions into mobile applications, it allows us to use the kinematic feasibility of the end-effector trajectory as a dense reward signal and its modular formulation allows it to generalise to unseen end-effector motions at test time.

The approach of Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) can support human operators especially those without much programming experience to control a collaborative robot (cobot) in an intuitive and convenient means. Gaussian Mixture Model and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMM and GMR) are useful tools for implementing such a LfD approach.

To address this issue, this paper presents a novel optimised approach to improve Gaussian clusters then further GMM/GMR so that LfD enabled cobots can carry out a variety of complex manufacturing tasks effectively.

â¢

An effective and cheap humanârobot interaction method using RGB-D imaging and an attitude teaching device is proposed. With the humanârobot interaction method, a local operator can complete the trajectory planning (including the path planning and orientation planning of the end effector of the robot) of a remote robot effectively.

â¢

A tele-AR registration method, which makes the coordinate system of the virtual robot coincide with that of the physical robot, is proposed.
Augmented reality (AR)-based programming using the demonstration method has been widely studied. However, studies on AR-based programming for remote robots are lacking because of the limitation of humanâcomputer interaction. This paper proposes an AR-based robot teleoperation system and method using RGB-D imaging and an attitude teaching device. By sending the color and depth images of the remote robot environment to the local side, the operators can complete the teleoperation of the robot at the local side. First, the operators select key positions on the motion path of the robot endpoint from color images via a mouse, and the computer calculates the 3D coordinates of these key points in the robot base coordinate system to complete the position teaching process. In the robot attitude teaching process, the AR technology is used to superimpose the virtual robot model onto the color images of the robot teleoperation environment, so as to make the virtual robot endpoint to move along the teaching path. An operator can use the portable attitude teaching device designed in this study to control the robot movement parameters, such as the attitude and motion speed, during the movement of the virtual robot. After the position and attitude teaching processes, the robot movement trajectory can be generated. To make the base coordinate system of the virtual model consistent with that of the physical robot, we propose an online AR registration method, which does not require manually placing the AR registration marker. The proposed AR-based robot teleoperation system can quickly and easily complete robot teleoperation at the local side.",NO,0,highlights effective cheap humanrobot interaction method using rgb imaging attitude teaching device proposed humanrobot interaction method local operator complete trajectory planning including path planning orientation planning end effector robot remote robot effectively telear registration method makes coordinate system virtual robot coincide physical robot proposed augmented reality ar based programming using demonstration method widely studied however studies arbased programming remote robots lacking limitation humancomputer interaction paper proposes arbased robot teleoperation system method using rgb imaging attitude teaching device sending color depth images remote robot environment local side operators complete teleoperation robot local side first operators select key positions motion path robot endpoint color images via mouse computer calculates d coordinates key points robot base coordinate system complete position teaching process robot attitude teaching process ar technology used superimposed virtual robot model onto color images robot teleoperation environment make virtual robot endpoint move along teaching path operator use portable attitude teaching device designed study control robot movement parameters attitude motion speed movement virtual robot position attitude teaching processes robot movement trajectory generated make base coordinate system virtual model consistent physical robot propose online ar registration method require manually placing ar registration marker proposed arbased robot teleoperation system quickly easily complete robot teleoperation local side,augmented realitybased robot teleoperation system using rgb imaging attitude teaching device

Manufacturing companies are in constant need for improved agility. An adequate combination of speed, responsiveness, and business agility to cope with fluctuating raw material costs is essential for todayâs increasingly demanding markets. Agility in robots is key in operations requiring on-demand control of a robotâs tool position and orientation, reducing or eliminating extra programming efforts. Vision-based perception using full-state or partial-state observations and learning techniques are useful to create truly adaptive industrial robots. We propose using a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to solve path-following tasks using a simplified virtual environment with domain randomisation to provide the agent with enough exploration and observation variability during the training to generate useful policies to be transferred to an industrial robot. We validated our approach using a KUKA KR16HW robot equipped with a Fronius GMAW welding machine. The path was manually drawn on two workpieces so the robot was able to perceive, learn and follow it during welding experiments. It was also found that small processing times due to motion prediction (3.5 ms) did not slow down the process, which resulted in smooth robot operations. The novel approach can be implemented onto different industrial robots to carry out different tasks requiring material deposition.

The development of service robots combines multiple fields of research, from object perception to object manipulation. The state-of-the-art continues to improve to make a proper coupling between object perception and manipulation. This coupling is necessary for service robots not only to perform various tasks in a reasonable amount of time but also to continually adapt to new environments and safely interact with non-expert human users. Nowadays, robots are able to recognize various objects, and quickly plan a collision-free trajectory to grasp a target object in predefined settings. Besides, in most of the cases, there is a reliance on large amounts of training data. Therefore, the knowledge of such robots is fixed after the training phase, and any changes in the environment require complicated, time-consuming, and expensive robot re-programming by human experts. Therefore, these approaches are still too rigid for real-life applications in unstructured environments, where a significant portion of the environment is unknown and cannot be directly sensed or controlled. In such environments, no matter how extensive the training data used for batch learning, a robot will always face new objects. Therefore, apart from batch learning, the robot should be able to continually learn about new object categories and grasp affordances from very few training examples on-site. Moreover, apart from robot self-learning, non-expert users could interactively guide the process of experience acquisition by teaching new concepts, or by correcting insufficient or erroneous concepts. In this way, the robot will constantly learn how to help humans in everyday tasks by gaining more and more experiences without the need for re-programming.

In unstructured orchard environments, picking a target fruit without colliding with neighboring branches is a significant challenge for guava-harvesting robots. This paper introduces a fast and robust collision-free path-planning method based on deep reinforcement learning. A recurrent neural network is first adopted to remember and exploit the past states observed by the robot, then a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) predicts a collision-free path from the states. A simulation environment is developed and its parameters are randomized during the training phase to enable recurrent DDPG to generalize to real-world scenarios. We also introduce an image processing method that uses a deep neural network to detect obstacles and uses many three-dimensional line segments to approximate the obstacles. Simulations show that recurrent DDPG only needs 29Â ms to plan a collision-free path with a success rate of 90.90%. Field tests show that recurrent DDPG can increase grasp, detachment, and harvest success rates by 19.43%, 9.11%, and 10.97%, respectively, compared to cases where no collision-free path-planning algorithm is implemented.

The system was developed in Java programming language, and its main purpose is learning process improvement. Using this software, finite automata can be defined in a graphical editor in the form of a state diagram, or by defining the transition function using the transition table. Upon defining an automaton, it is possible to run a visual simulation of the automaton operation for an arbitrary input string, whereby a textual description of the automaton simulation is also obtained. Furthermore, the system allows for conversion of regular expressions to deterministic finite automata and nondeterministic finite automata.

A new malicious PowerShell scripts detection method based on hybrid features.

â¢

A new dataset collected from open source repositories of malicious PowerShell scripts detection.

â¢

New discoveries of the gap between malicious scripts and benign scripts in different levels.

â¢

Our experiments has shown that detection model based hybrid features perform well in complex data set.
At present, network attacks are rampant in the Internet world, and the attack methods of hackers are changing steadily. PowerShell is a programming language based on the command line and.NET framework, with powerful functions and good compatibility. Therefore, hackers often use PowerShell malicious scripts to attack the victims in APT attacks. When these malicious PowerShell scripts are executed, hackers can control the victimâs computer or leave a backdoor on their computers. In this paper, a detection model of malicious PowerShell scripts based on hybrid features is proposed, we analyzed the differences between malicious and benign samples in text characters, functions, tokens and the nodes of the abstract syntax tree. Firstly, the script of PowerShell is embedded by FastText. Then the textual features, token features and the nodes features of PowerShell code extracted from the abstract syntax tree are added. Finally, the hybrid features of scrips will be classified by a Random Forest classifier. In the experiment, the malicious scripts are inserted into the benign scripts to weaken the features of the malicious samples in the level of abstract syntax tree nodes and tokens, which makes the scripts more complex. Even in such a complex data set, the proposed model which is based on hybrid features still achieves an accuracy of 97.76% in fivefold cross-validation. Moreover, the accuracy of this proposed model on the original scripts is 98.93%, which means that the proposed model has the ability to classify complex scripts.

Aiming at human-robot collaboration in manufacturing, the operator's safety is the primary issue during the manufacturing operations. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach to realize the real-time collision-free motion planning of an industrial robot for human-robot collaboration. Firstly, the safe human-robot collaboration manufacturing problem is formulated into a Markov decision process, and the mathematical expression of the reward function design problem is given. The goal is that the robot can autonomously learn a policy to reduce the accumulated risk and assure the task completion time during human-robot collaboration. To transform our optimization object into a reward function to guide the robot to learn the expected behaviour, a reward function optimizing approach based on the deterministic policy gradient is proposed to learn a parameterized intrinsic reward function. The reward function for the agent to learn the policy is the sum of the intrinsic reward function and the extrinsic reward function. Then, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm intrinsic reward-deep deterministic policy gradient (IRDDPG), which is the combination of the DDPG algorithm and the reward function optimizing approach, is proposed to learn the expected collision avoidance policy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested in a simulation environment, and the results show that the industrial robot can learn the expected policy to achieve the safety assurance for industrial human-robot collaboration without missing the original target. Moreover, the reward function optimizing approach can help make up for the designed reward function and improve policy performance.",NO,0,highlights method safe interaction industrial humanrobot collaboration proposed specific reward function intrinsic reward extrinsic reward designed safety task considered simultaneously contributes safe humanrobot collaboration reward shaping aiming humanrobot collaboration manufacturing operator safety primary issue manufacturing operations paper presents deep reinforcement learning approach realize realtime collisionfree motion planning industrial robot humanrobot collaboration firstly safe humanrobot collaboration manufacturing problem formulated markov decision process mathematical expression reward function design problem given goal robot autonomously learn policy reduce accumulated risk assure task completion time humanrobot collaboration transform optimization object reward function guide robot learn expected behaviour reward function optimizing approach based deterministic policy gradient proposed learn parameterized intrinsic reward function reward function agent learn policy sum intrinsic reward function extrinsic reward function deep reinforcement learning algorithm intrinsic rewarddeep deterministic policy gradient irddpg combination ddpg algorithm reward function optimizing approach proposed learn expected collision avoidance policy finally proposed algorithm tested simulation environment results show industrial robot learn expected policy achieve safety assurance industrial humanrobot collaboration without missing original target moreover reward function optimizing approach help make designed reward function improve policy performance,deep reinforcement learningbased safe interaction industrial humanrobot collaboration using intrinsic reward function

This longitudinal study examined changes in Computational Thinking (CT) skills in first and second grade students exposed to a developmentally appropriate coding curriculum. The âCoding as Another Languageâ (CAL) curriculum spans seven weeks and uses the KIBO robot to engage students in learning that integrates programming and literacy concepts. We compared children receiving CAL (NÂ =Â 667) to a control group (NÂ =Â 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (No-CAL). TechCheck, a validated âunpluggedâ CT assessment suitable for young children regardless of their coding experience, was used to measure CT. Over the course of the study, children who received CAL-KIBO improved on TechCheck (MchangeÂ =Â 0.94, pÂ <Â .001) whereas the No-CAL group did not change significantly (MchangeÂ =Â 0.27, pÂ =Â .07). Accounting for demographic factors, baseline performance and classroom (teacher) effects, CAL exposure was a significant predictor of post-test CT scores (pÂ <Â .01). Improvements in CT measured by TechCheck over seven weeks of the CAL-KIBO curriculum were consistent with approximately six months of development without coding instruction. Secondary analysis stratified by grade revealed decisive evidence that CAL exposure improved scores in first grade and anecdotal evidence that second grade scores improved. The CT domains that showed improvement in children who received CAL-KIBO included algorithms, modularity, and representation.

In such vein, this paper introduces a system whose main objective is identifying a person having alcohol in the blood through supervised classification of sensor-generated and computer-vision-based data. To do so, some drunk-status criteria are considered, namely: the concentration of alcohol in the car environment, the facial temperature of the driver and the pupil width.

Acquired data are analyzed into a two-stages machine learning system consisting of feature selection and supervised classification algorithms.

Verify the effectiveness of the DQN-MARL method in optimizing the completion time with various task spaces and agents.
Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) presents an opportunity to improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes. However, the existing task planning approaches for HRC are still limited in many ways, e.g., co-robot encoding must rely on expertsâ knowledge and the real-time task scheduling is applicable within small state-action spaces or simplified problem settings. In this paper, the HRC assembly working process is formatted into a novel chessboard setting, in which the selection of chess piece move is used to analogize to the decision making by both humans and robots in the HRC assembly working process. To optimize the completion time, a Markov game model is considered, which takes the task structure and the agent status as the state input and the overall completion time as the reward. Without expertsâ knowledge, this game model is capable of seeking for correlated equilibrium policy among agents with convergency in making real-time decisions facing a dynamic environment. To improve the efficiency in finding an optimal policy of the task scheduling, a deep-Q-network (DQN) based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is applied and compared with the Nash-Q learning, dynamic programming and the DQN-based single-agent reinforcement learning method.

Especially, clogs and jams are easily triggered in width-changing areas. In this article, we consider pedestrian movement in heterogeneous corridors and design an optimal feedback control to regulate pedestrian flow. Flow characteristics are first studied based on microscopic social-force simulations. A Gaussian process describes the relationship between flow variables with the observation data. The macroscopic model for flow in heterogeneous corridors is developed. To avoid jams, discharges among these corridors are balanced with the narrowest corridor as the primary concern. At the equilibrium, a continuous-time nonlinear control system is formulated, and the adaptive dynamic programming learns the optimal feedback controller. Policy iteration (PI) and neural networks are combined together, and the convergence of neural-network-based PI is demonstrated by analyzing its equivalence to the GaussâNewton method. Batch normalization is introduced to stabilize the learning process. Simulated experiments demonstrate that the control design can effectively regulate pedestrian flow for both macroscopic and microscopic models.

It is used in many different areas, such as in face-detecting systems [16, 34, 37], surveillance tools [9], human-machine interfaces [17], and self-driving cars [18, 23, 25, 26, 30]. These days, deep learning object detection approaches have achieved significantly better performance than the classical feature-based algorithms. Darknet [31] is a deep learning object detection framework, which is well known for its fast speed and simple structure. Unfortunately, Darknet can only work with Nvidia CUDA [6] for accelerating its deep learning calculations. For this reason, users have only limited options of selecting appropriate graphic cards. Open computing language (OpenCL) [35], an open standard for cross-platform, parallel programming of heterogeneous systems, is available for the general hardware accelerators. However, many deep learning frameworks including Darknet have no support for OpenCL.

In our previous paper, we presented OpenCL-Darknet [19], which transformed the CUDA-based Darknet into an open standard OpenCL backend. The original OpenCL-Darknet successfully showed its ability for the general graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware. However, it could not achieve competitive performance compared with the CUDA version, and it only supported a limited platform. In this study, we improved the performance of OpenCL-Darknet with several optimization techniques and added support for various architectures. We also evaluated OpenCL-Darknet not only in AMD R7 accelerated processing unit (APU) with OpenCL 2.0, but also in Nvidia GPU and ARM Mali embedded GPU with OpenCL 1.2 Profile. The evaluation using the standard object detection datasets showed that our advanced OpenCL-Darknet reduced the processing time by at most 50% on average for various deep learning object detection networks compared with our original implementation.

In this case, robotic tools are generally used considering two different paradigms: as the main focus and as a secondary focus. Actually, these paradigms define the way that Educational Robotics is implemented in schools. Most of the approaches have implemented it as the main focus, which is teaching Robotics. Nevertheless, there are quite a few works that implement robotics as a secondary focus, which is currently assisting the learning process in several disciplines.

This article follows this new trend, proposing a multi-agent system composed of a smart camera network, centralised planning agent, a virtual coach, and robotic exercise buddy, designed to promote regular physical activity habits among the elderly. The proposed system not only persuades the users to perform exercise routines, but also guides and accompanies them during exercises in order to provide effective training and engagement to the user. The different agents are combined in the system to exploit their complementary features in the quest for an effective and engaging training system. Three variants of the system, involving either a partial set of those agents or the full proposed system, were evaluated and compared through a pilot study conducted with 12 elderly users. The results demonstrate that all variants are able to guide the user in an exercise routine, but the most complete system that includes a robotic exercise buddy was the best scored by the participants.

Reducing planning time by locking search scope in the early stage of planning.

â¢

Some action selection strategies are proposed to improve the planning efficiency.
Fast path planning in unknown environment is important to reduce the loss of human and material resources. To reduce planning time while obtaining a short path, this paper proposes a Bidirectional Associative Learning Algorithm (BALA). In the proposed algorithm, an episode is defined as a bidirectional movement between the start point and the target point. The planning process in the BALA is divided into three stages: early stage, medium stage and end stage. In the early stage, the attraction of the target point is adopted to instruct the robot to select action. This strategy not only helps the robot avoid blind search, but also provides the search scope that may contain the global shortest path for the subsequent episodes. In the medium stage, we propose an action selection strategy based on the experience guidance, where the experience obtained in the obverse and reverse movements is used alternately to improve the learning efficiency of the robot. In the end stage, a strong connectivity relationship between nodes is defined. Planning by this relationship, the length of the final planned path will be the shortest based on the experience the robot obtains. The comparison results with Q-Learning and its improved algorithm reveal that the BALA demonstrates desirable and stable performance in planning efficiency in any environment, and it can well balance the planning time and path length.

By implementing the SGOA algorithm, a new collision-free safety path can be optimized for the robot with low priority.
In order to meet the real-time and accurate requirements of multi-robot path planning in dynamic environment, this paper adopted wireless sensor network to locate robots and obstacles and used an improved artificial intelligent algorithm to plan path. In this paper, a jumping mechanism particle swarm optimization (JPSO) algorithm and a safety gap obstacle avoidance algorithm (SGOA) algorithm were proposed. Compared with canonical PSO algorithm, JPSO algorithm has three improvement strategies: Fitness value evaluation function, new learning sample and jumping strategy. The JPSO algorithm updates the particles with poor comprehensive quality by jumping and adjusts the inertia weight adaptively according to fitness value evaluation function. With the cooperation of new learning samples, the global searching ability and precision of the algorithm can be improved. SGOA algorithm is mainly aimed at the problem that robots with low priority are stuck in a long wait and cannot continue to walk when avoiding obstacles. By implementing the SGOA algorithm, a new collision-free safety path can be optimized for the robot with low priority. In order to verify JPSO and SGOA algorithm, a lot of experiments were done. JPSO algorithm was compared with two other improved PSO algorithms with 6 standard test functions. The path planning and obstacle avoidance experiments of six robots were realized using the JPSO and SGOA algorithm.

Current tiling robots for area coverage have fixed forms and are limited to cleaning only certain areas. The reconfigurable system is the creative answer to such an optimal coverage problem. The tiling robotâs goal enables the complete coverage of the entire area by reconfiguring to different shapes according to the areaâs needs. In the particular sequencing of navigation, it is essential to have a structure that allows the robot to extend the coverage range while saving energy usage during navigation. This implies that the robot is able to cover larger areas entirely with the least required actions. This paper presents a complete path planning (CPP) for hTetran, a polyabolo tiled robot, based on a TSP-based reinforcement learning optimization. This structure simultaneously produces robot shapes and sequential trajectories whilst maximizing the reward of the trained reinforcement learning (RL) model within the predefined polyabolo-based tileset. To this end, a reinforcement learning-based travel sales problem (TSP) with proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm was trained using the complementary learning computation of the TSP sequencing. The reconstructive results of the proposed RL-TSP-based CPP for hTetran were compared in terms of energy and time spent with the conventional tiled hypothetical models that incorporate TSP solved through an evolutionary based ant colony optimization (ACO) approach.

In a multi-robot system, there can be multiple objectives to be achieved by multiple robots simultaneously. Nowadays, many mobile service robots are being used in warehouses to reduce running costs and overheads. In a large warehouse, there can be multiple robots to handle the number of operations. Planning a path means to find out the optimal route, and coordinating them means a collision-free route. To get both the parameters to reach their optimal level becomes a tedious task to achieve. The efficiency of overall warehouse operation can be improved by adequately addressing the coordination and path planning issues among the robots. In warehouses, each robot has to navigate to its destination by finding a collision-free optimal route in coordination with other robots. In this paper, a comparative study with the acclaimed path planning and coordination has been presented. The proposed smart approach has been presented for a multi-robot system to find a collision-free optimal path in a warehouse to handle storage pods.

In this approach, an ILP system (the learner) decomposes the learning problem into three separate stages: generate, test, and constrain. In the generate stage, the learner generates a hypothesis (a logic program) that satisfies a set of hypothesis constraints (constraints on the syntactic form of hypotheses). In the test stage, the learner tests the hypothesis against training examples. A hypothesis fails when it does not entail all the positive examples or entails a negative example. If a hypothesis fails, then, in the constrain stage, the learner learns constraints from the failed hypothesis to prune the hypothesis space, i.e. to constrain subsequent hypothesis generation. For instance, if a hypothesis is too general (entails a negative example), the constraints prune generalisations of the hypothesis. If a hypothesis is too specific (does not entail all the positive examples), the constraints prune specialisations of the hypothesis. This loop repeats until either (i) the learner finds a hypothesis that entails all the positive and none of the negative examples, or (ii) there are no more hypotheses to test.

Path planning is a fundamental and critical task in many robotic applications. For energy-constrained robot platforms, path planning solutions are desired with minimum time arrivals and minimal energy consumption. Uncertain environments, such as wind conditions, pose challenges to the design of effective minimum time-energy path planning solutions. In this article, we develop a minimum time-energy path planning solution in continuous state and control input spaces using integral reinforcement learning (IRL). To provide a baseline solution for the performance evaluation of the proposed solution, we first develop a theoretical analysis for the minimum time-energy path planning problem in a known environment using the Pontryagin's minimum principle. We then provide an online adaptive solution in an unknown environment using IRL. This is done through transforming the minimum time-energy problem to an approximate minimum time-energy problem and then developing an IRL-based optimal control strategy. Convergence of the IRL-based optimal control strategy is proven. Simulation studies are developed to compare the theoretical analysis and the proposed IRL-based algorithm.",NO,0,summary path planning fundamental critical task many robotic applications energyconstrained robot platforms path planning solutions desired minimum time arrivals minimal energy consumption uncertain environments wind conditions pose challenges design effective minimum timeenergy path planning solutions article develop minimum timeenergy path planning solution continuous state control input spaces using integral reinforcement learning irl provide baseline solution performance evaluation proposed solution first develop theoretical analysis minimum timeenergy path planning problem known environment using pontryagin minimum principle provide online adaptive solution unknown environment using irl done transforming minimum timeenergy problem approximate minimum timeenergy problem developing irlbased optimal control strategy convergence irlbased optimal control strategy proven simulation studies developed compare theoretical analysis proposed irlbased algorithm,integral reinforcement learningbased approximate minimum timeenergy path planning unknown environment

642,10.1108/IR-01-2020-0010,,Effectiveness of multi-gated sequence model for the learning of kinematics and dynamics of an industrial robot,ar,Singh A.,"Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad",Industrial Robot,Journal,"Purpose

For efficient trajectory control of industrial robots, a cumbersome computation for inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics is needed, which is usually developed using spatial transformation using DenavitâHartenberg principle and Lagrangian or NewtonâEuler methods, respectively. The model is highly non-linear and needs to deal with uncertainties because of lack of accurate measurement of mechanical parameters, noise and non-inclusion of joint friction, which results in some inaccuracies in predicting accurate torque trajectories. To get a guaranteed closed form solution, the robot designers normally follow Pieperâs recommendation and compromise with the mechanical design. While this may be acceptable for the industrial robots where the aesthetic look is not that important, it is not for humanoid and social robots. To help solve this problem, this study aims to propose an alternative machine learning-based computational approach based on a multi-gated sequence model for finding appropriate mapping between Cartesian space to joint space and motion space to joint torque space.

Design/methodology/approach

First, the authors generate sufficient data required for the sequence model, using forward kinematics and forward dynamics by running N number of nested loops, where N is the number of joints of the robot. Subsequently, to develop a learning-based model based on sequence analysis, the authors propose to use long short-term memory (LSTM) and hence, train an LSTM model, the architecture details of which have been discussed in the paper. To make LSTM learning algorithms perform efficiently, the authors need to detect and eliminate redundant features from the data set, which the authors propose to do using an elegant statistical tool called Pearson coefficient.

Findings

To validate the proposed model, the authors have performed rigorous experiments using both hardware and simulation robots (Baxter/Anukul robot) available in their laboratory and KUKA simulation robot data set made available from Neural Learning for Robotics Laboratory. Through several characteristic plots, it has been shown that a sequence-based LSTM model of deep learning architecture with non-redundant features could help the robots to learn smooth and accurate trajectories more quickly compared to data sets having redundancy. Such data-driven modeling techniques can change the future course of direction of robotics research for solving the classical problems such as trajectory planning and motion planning for manipulating industrial as well as social humanoid robots.

Originality/value

The present investigation involves development of deep learning-based computation model, statistical analyses to eliminate redundant features, data creation from one hardware robot (Anukul) and one simulation robot model (KUKA), rigorously training and testing separately two computational models (specially configured two LSTM models) â one for learning inverse kinematics and one for learning inverse dynamics problem â and comparison of the inverse dynamics model with the state-of-the-art model.

Several studies showed that endowing robots of human-like interaction skills can not only make them more likeable but also improve their performance. In particular, skill transfer by imitation learning can increase the usability and acceptability of robots by users without computer programming skills. In fact, besides positional information, muscle stiffness of the human arm and contact force with the environment also play important roles in understanding and generating human-like manipulation behaviors for robots, e.g., in physical HRI and teleoperation. To this end, we present a novel robot learning framework based on dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), taking into consideration both the positional and contact force profiles for human-robot skills transferring. Distinguished from the conventional method involving only the motion information, the proposed framework combines two sets of DMPs, which are built to model the motion trajectory and the force variation of the robot manipulator, respectively. Thus, a hybrid force/motion control approach is taken to ensure the accurate tracking and reproduction of the desired positional and force motor skills. Meanwhile, in order to simplify the control system, a momentum-based force observer is applied to estimate the contact force instead of employing force sensors. To deploy the learned motion-force robot manipulation skills to a broader variety of tasks, the generalization of these DMP models in actual situations is also considered.

To this end, this work proposes (1) a unified representation of obstacles and targets to capture the underlying dynamics of the environment while allowing generalization to unseen goals and (2) a flexible end-to-end model combining the unified representation with the deep reinforcement learning control module that can be trained by interacting with the environment. Such a representation is agnostic to the shape and appearance of the underlying objects, which simplifies and unifies the scene representation in both simulated and real worlds. We implement this idea with a vision-based actor-critic framework by devising a bounding box predictor module. The predictor estimates the 3D bounding boxes of obstacles and targets from the RGB-D input. The features extracted by the predictor are fed into the policy network, and all the modules are jointly trained. This makes the policy learn object-aware scene representation, which leads to a data-efficient learning of the obstacle avoidance policy. Our experiments in simulated environment and the real-world show that the end-to-end model of the unified representation achieves better sim2real adaption and scene generalization than state-of-the-art techniques.",NO,0,obstacle avoidance robotic manipulators challenging operate unstructured environments problem probed simtoreal simreal deep reinforcement learning moving policy robotic arm learnt simulator adapted real world however problem simreal adaptation notoriously difficult end work proposes unified representation obstacles targets capture underlying dynamics environment allowing generalization unseen goals flexible endtoend model combining unified representation deep reinforcement learning control module trained interacting environment representation agnostic shape appearance underlying objects simplifies unified scene representation simulated real worlds implement idea visionbased actorcritic framework devising founding box predictor module predictor estimates d founding boxes obstacles targets rgb input features extracted predictor fed policy network modules jointly trained makes policy learn objectaware scene representation leads dataefficient learning obstacle avoidance policy experiments simulated environment realworld show endtoend model unified representation achieves better simreal adaption scene generalization stateoftheart techniques,simreal learning obstacle avoidance robotic manipulators uncertain environments

Many European countries are switching from teaching information technologies to informatics education during the current second decade of this century. Informatics curriculum is becoming a central part of school education. We explain and design a way of developing informatics curriculum that offer the critical competences new generations need to survive and thrive in todaysâ knowledge society and will allow them to contribute to the future development of society. These competences also strongly support the development of their intellectual potential and creativity. Our design of informatics curriculum takes into account the interaction with other scientific disciplines as well with the subject didactics, pedagogy and psychology. The starting point is merging constructionism and critical thinking. Constructionism with its âlearning by doingâ and âlearning by getting things to workâ enables designing a teaching process in which students acquire knowledge by creating products, analysing the properties and the functionality of their own products, and finally derive motivation to improve these products. Critical thinking asks us not to teach products of science and technology and their application, but to teach the creative process of their development. To implement this approach, we use the historical method allowing the students to learn by productive failures in the process of searching for a solution.

This makes interpretability â a key requirement in exploratory data analysis â nearly impossible.

However, genetic programming-based manifold learning has struggled to match the performance of other approaches.

688,10.1109/TCYB.2020.2981480,,Bioinspired Scene Classification by Deep Active Learning With Remote Sensing Applications,ar,Zhang L.,Wenzhou University,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,Journal,"Accurately classifying sceneries with different spatial configurations is an indispensable technique in computer vision and intelligent systems, for example, scene parsing, robot motion planning, and autonomous driving. Remarkable performance has been achieved by the deep recognition models in the past decade. As far as we know, however, these deep architectures are incapable of explicitly encoding the human visual perception, that is, the sequence of gaze movements and the subsequent cognitive processes. In this article, a biologically inspired deep model is proposed for scene classification, where the human gaze behaviors are robustly discovered and represented by a unified deep active learning (UDAL) framework. More specifically, to characterize objects' components with varied sizes, an objectness measure is employed to decompose each scenery into a set of semantically aware object patches. To represent each region at a low level, a local-global feature fusion scheme is developed which optimally integrates multimodal features by automatically calculating each feature's weight. To mimic the human visual perception of various sceneries, we develop the UDAL that hierarchically represents the human gaze behavior by recognizing semantically important regions within the scenery. Importantly, UDAL combines the semantically salient region detection and the deep gaze shifting path (GSP) representation learning into a principled framework, where only the partial semantic tags are required. Meanwhile, by incorporating the sparsity penalty, the contaminated/redundant low-level regional features can be intelligently avoided.

In particular, robots are required not only to grasp, move, and release various home objects but also to plan the order and positions for placing the objects. In this paper, we propose a novel planning method that can efficiently estimate the order and positions of the objects to be tidied up by learning the parameters of a probabilistic generative model. The model allows a robot to learn the distributions of the co-occurrence probability of the objects and places to tidy up using the multimodal sensor information collected in a tidied environment. Additionally, we develop an autonomous robotic system to perform the tidy-up operation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by an experimental simulation that reproduces the conditions of the Tidy Up Here task of the World Robot Summit 2018 international robotics competition.

The left-arm and right-arm of the dual-arm robot each have a neural network to control its position and orientation. Dual-agent training, distributed training structure, and progressive training environment are used to train neural networks. During the training process, the motion of one arm is regarded as the environment of the other arm, and the two agents are trained at the same time. In the input part of the neural network of the proposed method, all parameters come from the angle of each axis and kinematic calculation, no additional sensors are needed, so the method is easier to transplant to different dual-arm robots. With some appropriate neural network inputs and reward functions design, the robot can perform the expected self-collision avoidance and effectively avoid the joint limits and singularities of the arm.

However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the recent evidence-based visual programming approaches that are applied in several domains. This study presents a systematic review to understand, compare, and reflect on recent visual programming approaches using twelve dimensions: visual programming classification, interaction style, target users, domain, platform, empirical evaluation type, test participants' type, number of test participants, test participants' programming skills, evaluation methods, evaluation measures, and accessibility of visual programming tools. The results show that most of the selected articles discussed tools that target IoT and education, while other fields such as data science, robotics are emerging. Further, most tools use abstractions to hide implementation details and use similar interaction styles. The predominant platforms for the tools are web and mobile, while desktop-based tools are on the decline. Only a few tools were evaluated with a formal experiment, whilst the remaining ones were evaluated with evaluation studies or informal feedback. Most tools were evaluated with students with little to no programming skills. There is a lack of emphasis on usability principles in the design stage of the tools. Additionally, only one of the tools was evaluated for expressiveness.

The âAssemblyâ tool is used to generate robot-independent intermediary program models, which are translated into robot-specific programs using a graphical user interface automation toolchain. The generalizability of the approach to list, tree, and block-based programming is assessed using three different robot programming environments, two of which are proprietary. The results of this evaluation suggest that the proposed approach is feasible for an entire range of programming models and thus enables the generation of programs in various proprietary robot programming environments.

Classical learning methods and planning methods for solving the optimization problems in MDP are discussed.

Q-ADP uses model-free Q-learning algorithm to learn state values through interactions with the environment, meanwhile, planning steps during the learning process opt for ADP to keep updating state values through several sample paths. A model of one-step transition probabilities is built based on the machines' reliability model, and serves the ADP algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, a numerical study is performed to show the production performance, compared to a standard Q-learning algorithm. The simulation results show that Q-ADP outperforms standard Q-learning under the same length of training process.

Dynamic window approach (DWA) is an effective method of local path planning, however some of its evaluation functions are inadequate and the algorithm for choosing the weights of these functions is lacking, which makes it highly dependent on the global reference and prone to fail in an unknown environment. In this paper, an improved DWA based on Q-learning is proposed. First, the original evaluation functions are modified and extended by adding two new evaluation functions to enhance the performance of global navigation. Then, considering the balance of effectiveness and speed, we define the state space, action space and reward function of the adopted Q-learning algorithm for the robot motion planning. After that, the parameters of the proposed DWA are adaptively learned by Q-learning and a trained agent is obtained to adapt to the unknown environment. At last, by a series of comparative simulations, the proposed method shows higher navigation efficiency and successful rate in the complex unknown environment.

Addressing this gap, Torino is a physical programming language for teaching computational learning to children ages 7â11 regardless of level of vision. To create code, children connect physical instruction pods and tune their parameter dials to create music, audio stories, or poetry. Currently, the uptake of novel educational technologies to support inclusive education of children with disabilities continues to be limited at scale. We consider how the Torino Learning Environment supports non-specialist teachers to teach computational learning to children with mixed visual abilities in a UK-wide evaluation with 75 children and 30 teachers over a period of three months. We demonstrate how children can successfully learn with a novel physical programming language. We articulate how key design constructs such as persistent program overview and liveness supported non-specialist teachers to co-produce learning for children of different ages, visual and cognitive abilities. We conclude with reflective guidance on evaluating inclusive educational technologies at scale.
